6,American Wedding,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-american-wedding-lyrics,"nostalgia,ULTRA.",True,"American love, American me, American you
American tear, American heartbreak, oh, oh, oh
I took a walk with the palm trees as the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen, talking to myself 
This tattoo on my left hand is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance, daydreams of you
My pretty woman in a ballgown, I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse, writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge with my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done that I just might die with
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much, but we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, that's American law
M-R-S dot Kennedy, she signed her name in pen
In a fancy, fancy cursive, then turned her term papers in
A thesis on Islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
Hijabs and polygamist husbands, those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me, jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know
She said, ""I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far""
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much, they don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, American divorce
Well, you can have my Mustang, that's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay, oh, if you stay
You'll probably leave later anyway, it's love made in the USA
Don't let 'em front you to saying you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Ain't gon' be tripping over some bitch-ass, dude
They so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you
You can get sensitive but the shit ain't true
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true
And nigga, if I did it, I think you can too
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do, that you can't do"
13,Bad Religion,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-bad-religion-lyrics,channel ORANGE,True,"Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?
He said ""Allahu akbar""
I told him, ""Don't curse me""
""Bo Bo, you need prayer""
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion, ooh
This unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love
Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
And you say ""Allahu akbar""
I told him, ""Don't curse me""
""Bo Bo, you need prayer""
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion
Oh, unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
No, no, ahh
It's a, it's a bad religion
To be in love with someone
Who could never love you
Oh-oh-oh, only bad, only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do"
16,Be Yourself,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-be-yourself-lyrics,Blonde,True,"Many college students have gone to college
And gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else
Don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself, be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana
Because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control
Then it's regulated
Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye"

Whatever"

56,Close to You,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-close-to-you-lyrics,Blonde,True,"I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Don’t have much longer baby
Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
Just like me, they long to be close to you"
59,Crack Rock,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-crack-rock-lyrics,channel ORANGE,True,"You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde, you used to hit it raw
'Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and you broke your home
Crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
Crooked cop, dead cop
How much dope can you push to me?
Crooked cop, dead cop
No good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot, three hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped and don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds 
Don't no one hear the shells 
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock, crack rock, crack rock
How you feeling, girl?
How's the gutter doing?
Crack rock"
70,Dust,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-dust-lyrics,"nostalgia,ULTRA.",True,"Who's that talking in the library?
Who's that talking in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place be without my muse
Nothing special, every book in here I wrote
Some I'm not too proud of some I wish I could burn
So many pages I wrote, wish I could revise them
But there's no erasing and the best advice I got
Was keep writing, and keep living, and keep loving
And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we dust, dust
Who's that laughing in my library?
Who's that laughing in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place be without your smile
Nothing special, I fell in love with you girl
You let yourself inside with no respect for privacy
You said there's too much on my mind
Then you ripped out a page and set that shit on flame
I quit writing, I kept living, I kept loving
And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we dust, dust"
73,End/Golden Girl,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-end-golden-girl-lyrics,channel ORANGE,True,"Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands
There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' you this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see
She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight, but I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k 
But the sky's never grey 
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night, but I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k 
But the sky's never grey 
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
I'mma stay right here, with you
Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes, I've found my gold
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k 
But the sky's never grey 
Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Thanks for fucking with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see, I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green"
76,Facebook Story,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-facebook-story-lyrics,Blonde,True,"I was just telling that I got this girl before
And I was together since 3 years
And uhh, I was not even cheating her or what
And Facebook arrived and, uh
She wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it because I was like in front of her
And she told me like ""Accept me on Facebook""
It was virtual, means no sense
So I say ""I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook""
She started to be crazy
She thought that because I didn't accept her
She thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, ""It's over, I can't believe you""
I said ""come on, you're crazy, because like yeah
I'm in front of you, I'm every day here in your house""
That's, it means like it's jealousy
Pure jealousy for nothing
You know, virtual thing"

If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day

Call my Momma like, ""Momma
I ain't making minimum wage, Momma

Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Ménage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say, that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas want fight in the streets
Now shit starting to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email, said I oughta act my net worth
Dog this is chess now, not fetch

You could change this track now
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago

Make sure you speak up
Okay

Yo, ayy be quiet. What's your name? What do you do? What's your first memory?
The first word I learned to say or that I ever said
What's the most amazing thing you've ever witnessed?
Friendship and how it controls the world, hahaha
Hahaha, alright, um, what three superpowers do you wish you had? They say they have to be...
Flying, super strength...
Alright, what's your name?
Maybe we can get a little—a little bit, a little bit, a little bit
I wish I could sleep without, like, being dead
But forever at the same time
Yo, what, what's, what's the... dog, stop, stop, stop
And ships could fly. Buildings would be very, very tall
And everybody won't know the ground is up
Chloe, shh, okay, start over right now
Best thing about being me is I got a nice set of friends
Pretty clear mind, I feel like, sometimes
Probably, uh, being great
I think a lot, a lot, too much. Sometimes I'm very messy
Talents, got any secret talents?
I don't think so, I'm pretty open and all in everything that I do
Talents? Um, I can play the theremin
Probably, uh, probably Tyler, his life seems pretty awesome
No, actually, no, fuck him. Um, I don't know
Probably Dill 'cause he doesn't have to do anything at all
Just sits inside his house
What's your name?
Sage Elsesser
What do you do?
I play soccer and I go to school
Um, I wanna be better at skating
(It's probably up something really high, it's super high
I tried to land, like, a handstand or something)
Alright, that's it...
I spend a couple hours with my family and I go out
And do everything that I ever thought about trying
How far is a light year? How far is a light year?"

Here's to the highlights when I was convinced

The start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

The start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', had no chance to prepare
Couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say

Been breathing so hard, we both could use the oxygen 
Just hop on my back, I'll take you down the stairs 
Into my backyard and lay you right on the grass 
Give it to you over again, over again
Over again, over again
Making love, underneath the cherry leaves
Baby girl, tell me how my nature feels
Said oh baby, up against the cherry tree
Baby girl, I'll give it to you naturally, naturally
Feeling like Adam when he first found out this existed 
Me and my Eve trying out our first positions
And it's all good, and it's all free, and it's all you, and it's only me
Playing in the dirt wrestling myself inside you, yeah 
Give it you over again, over again
Over again, over again
Making love, underneath the cherry leaves
Baby girl, tell me how my nature feels
Said oh baby, up against the cherry tree
Baby girl, I'll give it to you naturally
My cavewoman, I'm a caveman
Doing wild things in a wild land
We keep going baby, we keep getting it baby
We'll get pebbles maybe, a couple bam bams
Bam bam, bang bang
Girl, your heart goes bam and bang
Feel my heart go, go, go
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now!
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now!

No, you can't make everybody equal

You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade 
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you, 
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you, everybody needs you

Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, every day shit
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit

Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, my every day shit
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
All the reverends
Preachin' self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation

Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'
I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you

It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
And disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
Absolutely nothing

Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley, at least you workin'
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said ""don't let the high go to waste""
But can you taste a little taste
Novacane, baby, baby
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb
Sink full of dishes, pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin'
I'm feelin' like Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow, I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had, never had, never had 
And ever since I've been tryna get it back, and pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smokin' anyway?

You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
'Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known
I know what I was on
I had a Pilot Jones 
She took me high 
Then she took me home 
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reachin' up your blouse
And no, I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while
By the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known, ever known
I know what I was on

I saw the sky like I never seen before

I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin

Thick girls are made for cuddlin'

Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me 
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here
Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs 
Gimme something sweet

The throne of our queen is empty

Chandeliers inside the pyramids, tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold

I found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb

Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed

High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon

That's a pretty long third gear in this car

Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older 
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy 
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
We smell of Californication
Strike a pose
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows
Can you come when I call again?
On comes the evening, gold seeking ends
Piece in my hands worth twice than a friend

Because I'm stronger and the Congo is dim

Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo
By myself
Solo, solo, solo, solo"
229,Solo (Reprise),https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-solo-reprise-lyrics,Blonde,True,"Ayy, ayy, so now I'm—
So low that I can see under the skirt of an ant
So low that I don't get high no more
When I ""geronimo!,"" I just go ""heh""
Solo, my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
So low that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
It ain't an event no more
So low that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do, I cut the pony off
Now there's a hole that once was a logo, how fitting
So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Sayin' they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you, ant
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive
But darling this only worsens
So low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So low that when they throw pussy or pesos
I pay no attention to it
So low that I am no rookie but feel like a kid
Lookin' at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment
Watchin' the summer come close to an end
After 20 years in, I'm so naïve I was under the impression
That everyone wrote they own verses
It's comin' back different and, yeah, that shit hurts me
I'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving
I've stumbled and lived every word
Was I working just way too hard?"
232,Songs For Women,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-songs-for-women-lyrics,"nostalgia,ULTRA.",True,"Haha
When I was younger, I used to wonder, like...
If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, ""Girl, don't be dumb—
I'm riding shotgun""
We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin
And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, i's cheating""
I say, ""Shit, oh well, oh well,"" ha
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
I say, ""Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were...""
'Cause, hell, if you were me, you'd be singin' to her
Like la-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm So Far Gone
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long
It's like she never heard of me, heard of me
Now, every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, ""Naw,"" they say, ""Okay, I don't believe it""
I say ""Nope, I swear, I never do it""
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Naw,"" they say, ""Who do you think you kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend""
Ah, ah
 Ooh, ah
Yeah
Fair enough
Fair enough
You see, I just don't play fair
But it's fair enough
'Cause your girl broke my heart in half
Ah, ah
I'm singing la-da, da-da ‘bout heartbreak
And now, I'm singing la-da, da-da 'bout love lost
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Damn
Haha
I'm saying though, like...
All I write is love songs
I mean, I try
I come to the studio
I—you know what I do
What you think I do it for? Huh?
Yeah, uh-huh
But you ain't listening, never
But if you were...
Might bug with it
Haha, yeah
All these songs for women
Songs for women
Songs for you, baby
For you"

241,Strawberry Swing,https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-strawberry-swing-lyrics,"nostalgia,ULTRA.",True,"When we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious, then
I'm still kicking, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting, all the world is at its end
Just in case an atom bomb comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear, I've loved
I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here
Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, ohh, even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved
I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times here
Spaceships are lifting off of a dying world
And millions are left behind while the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I, only you, goodbye, goodbye
Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time
Could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be gray
Without you I'm just miles away
The sky could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time"

Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

We are the Xanny-gnashing
Caddy-smashing, bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used that shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breachin' all these aqueducts
Don't believe us
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all they clothes revealing they tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
We party in my living room
'Cause father is gone
And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my hand
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

I'm searching for a real love, talking 'bout real love

Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life
The sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
The best song wasn't the single
But you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real

Live and die in the life
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born 
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach?
The sweet life
And the water is exactly what I wanted 
It's everything I thought it would be 
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy, ahh
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?

Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm drivin' 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin'
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
They never see them
And I've got this black suit on
Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good
Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah
Memory seats I'm sittin' on stay heated
I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference?
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze
Ever since I lost my baby
I've had this black suit on
Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
One more mile 'til the road runs out
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good
I'm goin' off 
Don't try stopping me
I'm goin' off 
Don't try saving 
No flares 
No vest 
And no fear
Waves are washin' me out
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good

My grandaddy was a player, pretty boy in a pair of gators
See I met him later on, think it was 1991
The only dad I'd ever know, but pretty soon he'd be gone 
Hide my face, hide my face, can't let 'em see me crying
Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
And they weren't crying, my friend said it wasn't so bad
You can't miss what you ain't had, well I can, I'm sad and
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho

Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed, we're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times
Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ahh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
In this life , in this life 
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You’re tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam"
