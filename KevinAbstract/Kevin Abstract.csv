3,American Boyfriend,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-american-boyfriend-lyrics,American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story,True,"Simple girl I ended up on your dad's doorstep
Suddenly, my body fell into yours
Bleachers only hold 
Thunder only grows 
It's all the same at dark, the sun don't care
Burn bridges, American Boyfriend 
No one knows, no one calls home
American Boyfriend 
I wanna die on sunset 
My parents wanna kill me, let 'em kill me
I'll finally be on TV
Bleachers only hold 
Thunder only grows 
It's all the same at dark, the sun don't care
Burn bridges, American Boyfriend 
No one knows, no one calls home

Burn bridges, American Boyfriend

5,American Problem,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-american-problem-lyrics,ARIZONA BABY,True,"Could you try 
To remember what you said tonight
Do you remember how high we was? 
If I, if I don't want to say sorry 
Then nigga, I won't 
Motherfuck a high road 
As it closes
Who touchin' now, who touchin' now, who touchin' my bag?
You're hurtin' me bad, I ain't seen the glass, it's the summer
I ain't going bad, better believe in that, had to creep in fast
Think I'm finna burn it, burn it to the ground, bruh
I drink, I smoke, I drink, I smoke, I drink until I sleep
I know, I know, I know, I know, this shit gon' catch up to me
I drink, I smoke, I drink, I smoke, I drink until I sleep
I know, I know, I know, I know, red wine gon' catch up to me
I can't sleep next to no one
Who don't look like, who don't look like you
And all my girlfriends, they tell me
""Well you would've been better if you picked someone who was just like you""
You gotta pass the thing over her
Yeah, yeah, yeah shawty, I
You gotta pass the thing over her
Yeah, shawty, West Side, yeah, West Side, shawty
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm stuck in the van with a mask on
Think about taking my life, but the plan's wrong
Think about finding a way to make the sand go, gone
I need another song to sing along to
Ninth grade, Tyler was the illest shit I ever heard
Going to his concerts, no mask, singing every word
I think it's kinda crazy how my life panned out
I think it sucks that you and I ain't work out
I used to sleep on Jon's couch, saying I'll be out this bitch sooner than later
17, I said I was gon' make some shit that was gon' be bigger than the FADER
I wanna be Paramount
I wanna move far away and buy my parents a house
I was obsessed with a blouse, I just liked the way it looked
I thought a brother was cute
He was older than his dawg, I was breaking the rules
I was a flaming faggot, that's what the principal called me
Not to my face, but I felt when I was stuck in his office
I'm just a, I'm just another American problem, my nigga
Uh, uh, yeah, uh
Another American problem"
8,Baby Boy,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-baby-boy-lyrics,ARIZONA BABY,True,"Every time I find myself I feel so lost
And every truth that I discover feels so false
And every mountain that I climb that seemed so tall
It only felt that way 'cause the valley was so small
Excuse me while I cry
At this point you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
Spent my days alone, when God left me all alone
He's all I got, he's all I got
I should let him know how much I need him now
He's all I got, he's all I got
Somethin' is missin' now
I need to find the right way to your house
Head lights pointed at the dawn, dawn
Stuck in the mosh pit, lost in the crowd
Somethin' is missin' now
I need to find the right way to your house
Head lights pointed at the dawn, dawn
Stuck in the mosh pit, lost in the crowd
At this point you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
Tell me if I'm in the wrong here
You know we belong here
You know that I'm sincere, always 
Why am I outside your hotel?
I'd rather you hold me, that's what you told me
Trying, trying, trying 
Trying, trying, trying"
12,Big Wheels,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-big-wheels-lyrics,ARIZONA BABY,True,"Big wheels on top, my
Heart rate don't stop, you
Might as well call the cops, fame
Turned a nigga to a opp, I
Been down so low, seen the floor
Turn boat loads into echoes, echoes, echoes, echoes
My niggas ain't see no more cash
I got rich way too fast
My mama still work at Sonic, nigga
I didn't even finish college, nigga
Got a lot of guilt inside of me
My niggas back home ain't proud of me
They think I'm a bitch, just queerbaitin'
Quit bein' a bitch and quit hatin'
Y'all pump fakin'
I'm a power bottom like a Free Mason
Y'all stuck playin', that's complacent, I'm cum-chasin'
My niggas back home got fundraisers
So self-centered, I'm amazin'
Took a nigga years, got dumb patience
Dumb, dumb parents what I been sayin'
Should've shook them niggas off like some dumb braces
Runnin' from nothin', and the haunted are somethin'
Tell my baby I want him, he keep me up when we fussin'
Under the sheets when we touchin'
I keep his work just to function
I can't hear him or nothin', for that, my nigga, we jumpin'"
13,Blink,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-blink-lyrics,American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story,True,"I feel, I feel like a new man
All I need is a mothafuckin' 
And a mothafuckin' 
And some new glasses
Wait, I got those, I got those!
Feet glued to the floor, baby, I need more of you
Your pores tells me more than a mothafuckin' whore do
I need rounds, I need 
I need drugs, I need 
I need companionship, I need an internship
I need a friend, I need you to hate me
I need you to tell me I'm better than Drake
I need attention, I need a flannel that's not bloody
I wish my mommy would try loving
I'm tired of everybody saying they don't want nothing
'Cause I wake up with my shoes missing
I'm tired of my dad saying he's gon' come home
And I wake up alone in the kitchen
No breakfast for me, my sister is gone
And she took the car
Have to take the bus, I'ma have to take the bus
I don't wanna take the bus
They hate me on the bus, they push me on the bus
That why I never wake up
That's why I snooze when my fucking phone go off
That's why I snooze
Say you ain't special, my baby
Say you ain't special, my baby
My hands, my hands in yours
I'll try to come back home
I'll tell you what
We coulda had a good life together, a fucking real good life
Had us a place of our own
But you didn't want it did ya? You didn't want it
Everything's built on that, that's all we got boy, fucking all
So I hope you know that if you don't never know the rest
You have no idea how bad it gets"
14,Boyer,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-boyer-lyrics,ARIZONA BABY,True,"I tell 'em I can't spit no game for free
Manage to rock back and forth, rap on your knees
My heart is in the streets where all my fucking niggas be
Boyer in the military in the deep blue sea
Parking lot, lot, lot, lot at H-E-B
Shit was right down the street from Chuck E Cheese
You cannot run forever, now
Gotta learn your lesson, child
You cannot run forever, now
Gotta learn your lesson, child
I tell my mama I ain't with the bullshit
Got Atlanta on my mind, I'm really fucking zooted
RIP my nigga Luke, just take me back to Houston
I was stuck inside apartments thinkin', ""What I'm doing?""
I was high as hell, hanging with my white friends
Thinkin' I'ma be alright if I'm just like them
Then the police pull up on me with the lights dimmed
Had me on the ground begging for my life, man
Like you cannot run forever, now
Gotta learn your lesson, child
You cannot run forever, now
Gotta learn your lesson, child
I been depressed like every fucking week
Ever since I left high school, I could barely breathe
Gotta take pills now just to help me sleep
Every day a new demon taking over me
I'm too scared to let a therapist talk to me
In turn it make the ones I love turn they back on me
Break the ones I love, turn they back on me
Break the ones I love, turn they back on me
You cannot run forever, now
Gotta learn your lesson, child
You cannot run forever, now
Gotta learn your lesson, child
You cannot run forever, now
Gotta learn your lesson, child
You cannot run forever, now
Gotta learn your lesson, child"
20,Corpus Christi,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-corpus-christi-lyrics,ARIZONA BABY,True,"None of my boys know how to cope with this shit
We was on tour in Europe, I tried coke with this kid
See I need anything that make me feel less lonely
I get called a snake, a liar, a faggot, and a phony
Sometimes I feel like all I'm gon’ have is my money
And my day one homies just gon' be left with their money
And I'll stare at the skies until they start to fade away
Me and my cousin would play ball all day trying to perfect that fadeaway
All our childhood dreams found a way to fade away
Tyler Perry movies dawg, and Michael Jackson videos
My aunt Becky passin’, my pride won't let me call her
I've been a bad nephew, son, boyfriend, whatever they call it
I just hope when it's my turn to not see tomorrow
Y'all can forgive me for any pain that I ever seemed to cause you
If you wake up feelin' more lonely than you felt yesterday
Then boy you gotta let me go then
If you wake up feelin' more lonely than you felt yesterday
Then boy you gotta let me go then
I wonder if Ameer think about me, or what he think about me
See when I think about me, I barely think about me
I think about the people that surround me, and how I let 'em down
I’m doin’ that right now by even fuckin' talkin’ 'bout this
I'm sorry Dom, I prolly shouldn't be puttin’ all our problems on the front lawn
Like that scene in Blow when George's mom called the feds 'cause it was hurtin' her rep
At what point do I do it for myself, instead of thinkin' 'bout the set?
I helped niggas get deals, I help niggas get healed
But I still feel like niggas wanna see me killed
Prolly 'cause my brother thought I was tryna see him killed
My sister be on Instagram tryna air me out
All because I won't give my niece a fuckin' shout out
If I ain't have Kelly I prolly would've stayed in Hawaii
My boyfriend more than an angel, it's a miracle he stuck by me
If you wake up feelin' more lonely than you felt yesterday
Then boy you gotta let me go then
If you wake up feelin' more lonely than you felt yesterday
Then boy you gotta let me go then
Why me, why me, why me, why me?"
21,Crumble,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-crumble-lyrics,ARIZONA BABY,True,"You got room in your phone for one more distraction
Wonderful times
Time is moving too slow for me to distract you
I need to get back to you
All my friends, all my dawgs that I got back home
We would look up at the sky, we was 10 years old
I'm my brother's keeper, let these demons show
Southern blood run deep so that genius grow
From the trees I hang, so low way go
Bands awake us from a slumber, yeah, dawg, I know
These petty motherfuckers don't know 'bout Big Moe
Rest in peace my nigga Luke, this a test of shit for sure
My brother Chris put me on and I will never take that from him
No matter how many times he called me ""faggot"" in the morning
Best thing 'bout being Mormon was seeing the white boy storm
And it's not my fault I like y'all, can't really explain it
Became the hood's favorite, I'm not ever a main bitch
My nigga, I'm just like SZA, they listen so I deliver
They found out my name was Clifford, I hide it, sometimes I'm lying
I'm tired of fucking crying and hiding behind a dummy, can I?
I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling outside of your window
I feel better with you
Telling you now, don't tell on the crew
Bet your loot hot, they tell you to move
Hollywood, I wish my brother would shoo
Take me back to my other issue
Was plastered with truth, feet on the roof
Drug in my veins, they shot up the place
My bro was an answer, then I was the glue
I don't think that they will ever get through
You see me standing there, heavyweight shoe
Me and my bro ain't never gon' choose
We on the loose, hands out the roof
Hand me my dro, I hand you your bag
All of my siblings end up like they dad
I remember what them charges was like
I don't want to be their burden tonight
The weight on my shoulders, I just can't get over
He won't take me back and they don't know how hard
They don't know how hard 
They don't know how hard 
They don't know how hard it is
I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling outside of your window
I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling outside of your window
And I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling outside of your window"
31,Echo,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-echo-lyrics,American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story,True,"Staring at the sky ain't gon' fix my problem
Staring at the sky ain't gon' fix my problem
Howling at the moon ain't gon' bring you back
Howling at the moon ain't gon' bring you back
Staring at the sky ain't gon' fix my problem
Staring at the sky ain't gon' fix my problem
Howling at the moon ain't gon' bring you back
Howling at the moon ain't gon' bring you back
I started smoking cigarettes, I even picked up pot again
Coke ain't touch my nose yet, I'm afraid I'll be just like my friend
I'm afraid I ain't gon' have no friends
Oh my god, when do my story end?
Tell me God, when do my story end?
I'm locked outside of the DeLorean
He was a bad son, he was a bad son
He was a bad son, he was a bad son
So he left home, so he left home
He had to run, yeah, he had to run, yeah
He had to run, yeah, he had to run, yeah
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
You can take a look into my eye
You can take a look into my eye
Go ahead and tell me what you find
You can take a look into my eye
You can take a look into my eye
You can take a look into my eye
Tell me what you like
Go ahead and tell me what you find
When it all fall down, where you going now?
When it all fall down, where you going now?
When it all fall down, where you run to now?
When it all come down, where you run to now?

32,Empty,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-empty-lyrics,American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story,True,"Sweaty palms as I walk down this empty road
I got a mom but we ain't spoke and I don't know
I had a heart that don't speak to me anymore
And life get hard but these last days mean many more
I'm just tryna get my bands up
While you running through the banners
I don't understand us, you should find your way 
I hate my yearbook photo
I hate my passport, I hate my last name
I hate everything it stands for, I should probably fucking transfer
Blue and brown JanSport, tired of public transport
I never went to prom, now I'm stuck on the dance floor
Just holding your hand, just holding your hand
And I'll be 
Right outside your front door on my 12 speed 
I got your emotions tattooed on my sleeve 
I think about you all the time, I've waited for you all my life
I need you right here by my side
Blowin' off my mom, I don't wanna go home
I'd rather be alone, I don't wanna go home
It's getting really late so I gotta go home
Mom's blowin' up my phone so I gotta go home
I love my mom, I hate my boyfriend
Do you love my mom? 
Do you hate my boyfriend? 
And I'll be
Right outside your front door on my 12 speed
I got your emotions tattooed on my sleeve
I think about you all the time, I've waited for you all my life
I need you right here by my side
I'll be 
Right outside your front door on my 12 speed 
I got your emotions tattooed on my sleeve 
I think about you all the time, I've waited for you all my life
I need you right here by my side
Empty home
Empty, empty, empty home
I wanna be American
My family’s gone, but I don’t care because I love

Same time I was cool with Uzi, dawg, my life felt like a movie
I left my troubled home, Hollywood, what the fuck am I doing?
I finally found peace, I suck when I get it
I see worth in myself, I won't run away again
I'm prayin' for my friends, they prayin' this won't end
But I know it does, just like all things

In this winehouse, all my dawgs need some help
What I'm cryin' 'bout when I'm all by myself
Long nights at the Mission Inn, long nights at the Mission Inn
Don't get me, uh, don't get me, uh
Don't get me twisted with your Mississippi love
Don't get me, uh, don't get me, uh

Don't get me, uh, don't get me, uh
Don't get me twisted with your Mississippi love
Don't get me, uh, don't get me, uh
Don't get me twisted now, boy, get me twisted now boy, boy
In the street in some Texas heat, and that's down the road from my cousin, now
Dance some more, close to Mexico and I tell my boys that I love them, uh
My feelings go when your feelings show
That's the stuff that always come and bless you now
Now you're pushin' my lovin', now you're pushin' my love
Tell me what you gotta do to try to keep it 
Tell me what I gotta do to try to keep it 
Tell me all the ones you know that held you down since '95
Do you wanna be my boyfriend, my Mississippi sunshine?
Big wedding, this brother basketball so late in the park with them
My feelings don't mean nothing whenever we arguin'
I'm drunk in the backseat, tryna figure out how I can get out this bitch
Do you wanna be my boyfriend, my Mississippi sunshine?
Don't get me, uh, don't get me, uh
Don't get me twisted with your Mississippi love
Don't get me, uh, don't get me, uh
Don't get me twisted now, boy, get me twisted now
Don't get me, uh, don't get me, uh
Don't get me twisted with your Mississippi love
Don't get me, uh, don't get me, uh
Don't get me twisted now, boy, get me twisted now boy, boy
Mississippi, Mississippi love
And I play it so much, I build, nigga
Mississippi, Mississippi love

70,Papercut,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-papercut-lyrics,American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story,True,"And just no break
A broken heart led me to you; she said ""I'm seeing through you""
And this before I knew you, way before I knew you
Back when darkness was all I had to hold
I smoke a bag of weed, all on my fucking own
And all them baddies all my favorite rappers rapped about
Never made sense when them words played in my fucking house
Now I'm on the highway, nearly passing out
With my feet hanging out the sunroof, my hands holding your hands
Driving past the sunset, I know I wanna marry you
It's kinda unbearable and that's pretty overwhelming
The feeling is brand new, eh, the feeling is brand new
But I still feel 17, it's like I just made MTV
It's like I just facetimed you for the first time last week
And that feeling will never leave
Different than all the highs, my life hit a new high
The harshest of all times, can't tell my family I'm bi
Can't tell my mother I'm gay
The hardest part of my day is wishing I was fucking straight
Life could be so fucking easy, man
I take everything for what it is and I never try to change it
I take everything for what it is and never try to change
I take everything for what it is and never try to change it, damn
And just no breakin' my heart
And just no breakin' my heart
Ooh, keep breakin'
Ooh, keep breakin', yeah
Ooh, keep breakin'
Ooh, break my heart
A bad man, bad man, a bad boy
Been a bad man, a bad man 
Been a bad boy, a bad boy 
Been a bad man, a bad man 
A bad boy, a bad boy 
Been a bad man, a bad man
A bad boy, a bad boy
I take everything for what it is and I never try to change it
I take everything for what it is and never try to change
I take everything for what it is and never try to change it"
71,Peach,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-peach-lyrics,ARIZONA BABY,True,"Ayy, she met me, let me fuck in the shower
I wrote my number in the mist on the mirror
I'm not the type to tell my homies about ya
You're not the type to hold me down through the year
I'll be your baby doll and your bodyguard if you tell me to
I'll try to make it all not as hard if you let me through
I ain't sign up for no bullshit
I told my baby that I'm bulletproof
Hands made me take two sips
All things I couldn't do
The cops come, then we dip, baby
Back when we was just friends, baby
Shit, man, you was just a baby
And I turned on you like Mother Nature
Try to think about the blueprint
All the shit that you told me not to do
Was breaking it worth it in the end
If I'm just a vision you come to?
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right
I'll be your baby doll and your bodyguard if you tell me to
I'll try to make it all not as hard if you let me through
I ain't tryna get the roof bent
Back then when I would ride with you
Short trips doing backflips
Mesmerized me, led me to the truth
Atlanta, we was kids, baby
Special moments with my friends, baby
Sippin' on some fuckin' gin, baby
And you wonder why we ain't win, baby
This year I ain't takin' no pics
I'm tryna get with the motion
I'm tryna get a promotion
Window shoppin' 'til they closin'
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right
I'll be your baby doll and your bodyguard if you tell me to
I'll try to make it all not as hard if you let me through
It's all peaches and cream
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right
If you left your love I'll be right"

Tripped in the dark, you found me
And boy I'll be back when you're lonely if you want me to
My parents don't know what's gotten into me since I've met you
And hold, hold
Hold, hold
When you wanna let go, when you wanna let go
When you wanna move on, move on, ooh
Why you gotta let go? Why you gotta let go?
Why you gotta move on? Move on, ooh
When you let
When you wanna let go, when you wanna let go
When you wanna move on, move on, ooh"
84,Seventeen,https://genius.com/Kevin-abstract-seventeen-lyrics,American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story,True,"He was everything I dreamed of
Used to ride around in his two seater
Being friends didn't make it much easier
Friday night lights, stay away from the bleachers
Showed me obscure bands he was into
His mom in the dining room, we're in his bedroom
His girl too, had to pretend like I ain't mind that bitch
Just so I could see his face
He introduced me to all his friends
I thought they were cooler than anyone I'd ever met before
Dressed well and we made a band
Honey moons and smoke breaks in a mini van
We'd drive through our trouble bubble
Screaming at mansions
Football pads become a memory
Football pads become a memory
A bad memory
You changed me for the better
You changed me for the better
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Known you for some time but it feels brand new
Try and go forget but we did that too
And I won't ever let you go
Ay, dog, got some problems we could runaway from
Search for a tree that you could hang on, stay down
Watch myself, watch myself watching you, you
You changed me for the better
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again
Do it all, do it all again

As you should, as you should
Suburbia born
Wake up every mornin', day dreamin' 'bout a foreign
He was born into some fortune, more American than Gordon
His views kinda different from my outlook, that's why he's gorgeous
Your parents hate me though
Think I like that shit, yeah, I like the thrill of it, yeah
I'm so imperfect, it's wack, I'm so aware of the fact
That I'll never in this lifetime get the chance to be with you
A perfect soul
A perfect hand to hold
Imperfect lonely roads
Pass the controller
Let the TV roam, yuh
While my hands is on ya
Football pads is on ya
You let me take 'em off ya
Just to get closer to you"

Got your name across my chest
Still sleeping with the window open
Why can't I get you out of my head, my head
You say these things just happen, why must we let them happen?
I quit my job the other day, even though I'm in need of the money
They say I threw my life away, no shit, I threw my life away
I quit my job the other day, even though I'm in need of the money
They say I threw my life away, no shit, I threw my life away

Dad tried to tell me that I'm not functional
I got a bunch of homies, but not a bunch of homes
Said come back home to an empty home
I got a different home, my home is...

I gotta different home, my home is fake

Told a lie and I'm sorry
Let me make it up at the football game
Pick you up in the morning
Let me make it up at the football game
Who was I when I was lonely
Let me make it up at the football game
I told a lie and I'm sorry, ooh
Told a lie and I'm sorry
Let me make it up at the football game
Pick you up in the morning

Here am I, Lord
Niggas was in that back room
See, I ain't sitting with that
Niggas was hitting that glass tube
Yeah, I ain’t fuckin' with that
Auntie was smoking that crack too
My mama was dealin' with that
Big skies out in Corpus
Them lights was so gorgeous
In the garage, I made a fortune
I’m still tryna fuck every Mormon
It's amazing how I'm still searching, y'all
Still reaching, man, fuck the law
Above the law, she above the law
Close the blinds, let the lights go off
Duck low in case they raid us all
And take it all with speed and ease
He like me on my knees
Generational trauma things
I wonder how far I could bring
This shit to my existence, my nigga
Can I get a witness? I lived it
Turn into a vicious, I spit it
Looked at me and rip it, just get it
You ain't the only one that's searching for that 1-9
You gotta go ahead and let that sun shine
Everything gon' be okay
I'm ’bout to steal a whip and drive that bitch to Montana
My feelings roll, that’s when I throw tantrum
LA, LA, LA road
Everything gon' be okay
I’m 'bout to steal a whip and drive that bitch to Montana
My feelings roll, that's when I throw tantrum
LA, LA, LA road"

All my sorrows, home tomorrow
All my luggage, expired passport
I think you hate me, the hell do I know?
Above ground level, I feel a crash coming
Jesus in my hand, I don't believe in nothing 
I wanna build a sandcastle for no reason
I never wanted to end up with you
And my, my, my, my, my
If the trees were yellow
That would cure my heartbreak
Memories fade, I let go
Just to give the clouds a break
If you really love me
You gotta sacrifice it baby
If you really want me
You gotta sacrifice it baby
If the trees were yellow
That would cure my heartbreak
Memories fade, I let go
Just to give the clouds a break
If you really love me
You gotta sacrifice it baby
If you really want me
You gotta sacrifice it baby
Special inconsistent moments hone in
This screen will never ever let us hold hands
I always wanted someone that could be free
Sand between my feet and the distance between
If the trees were yellow
That would cure my heartbreak
Memories fade, I let go
Just to give the clouds a break
If you really love me
You gotta sacrifice it baby
If you really want me
You gotta sacrifice it baby
Don't leave me on the edge
I wanna be yellow
Don't leave me on the edge
I wanna be yellow
I wanna be yellow
It's bright like yellow
It's so so yellow
It's bright like yellow
This song's so yellow
It's bright like yellow"
