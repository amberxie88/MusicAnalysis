0,3x5,https://genius.com/John-mayer-3x5-lyrics,Room for Squares,True,"I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been
And you held this letter
Probably got excited, but there's nothing else inside it
Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words
Today, skies are painted colors of a cowboy cliche
And strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky
Are next to mountains anyway
Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words
But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s
I guess you had to be there
Guess you had to be with me
Today I finally overcame
Trying to fit the world inside a picture frame
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way
But let me say
But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s"
3,83,https://genius.com/John-mayer-83-lyrics,Room for Squares,True,"I've these dreams I'm walking home
Home when it used to be
And everything is as it was
Frozen in front of me
Here I stand, 6 feet small
Romanticizing years ago
It's a bitter sweet feeling
Hearing ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" on the radio
And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I want to be Superman
Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
More like they were at the start of me
Heaven made in '83
Thinking about my brother, Ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother, John
But on an 18 month delay
Here I stand, 6 feet small
And smiling because I'm scared as hell
Kind of like my life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actor's names have changed, oh well
And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I want to be Superman
Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
More like they were at the start of me
Heaven made in '83
And most my memories have escaped me
Or confused themselves with dreams
If heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me
Care of 1983
You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards
Replace the shutters but
That's my plastic in the dirt
Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox?
When came the day that it got thrown away
And don't you think I should have had some say in that decision?"
7,A Face To Call Home,https://genius.com/John-mayer-a-face-to-call-home-lyrics,Born and Raised,True,"I am an architect
Of days that haven't happened yet
I can't believe a month is all it's been
You know my paper heart
The one I filled with pencil marks
I think I might have gone and inked you in
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home
So glad you didn't see
The nervous wreck I used to be
You'd never know a man could feel so small
And you never look at me
Like I'm a liability
I bet you think I've never been at all
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home, a face to call home
A face to call home
You got a face to call home
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home
Home home
Home home
Home home
Home home"
10,All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye,https://genius.com/John-mayer-all-we-ever-do-is-say-goodbye-lyrics,Battle Studies,True,"Just when I had you off my head
Your voice comes thrashing wildly through my quiet bed
You say you want to try again
But I've tried everything but giving in
Why do you want to break my heart again?
Why am I going to let you try when
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
I bought a ticket on a plane
And by the time it landed, you were gone again
I love you more than songs can say
But I can't keep running after yesterday, so
Why do you want to break my heart again?
Why am I going to let you try when
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
We say goodbye
We say goodbye
We say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye"
11,Assassin,https://genius.com/John-mayer-assassin-lyrics,Battle Studies,True,"I work in the dead of night
When the roads are quiet and no one is around
To track my moves, racing the yellow lights
To find the gate is open, she's waiting in the room
I just slip on through
You get in, you get done and then you get gone
You never leave a trace, or show your face, you get gone
Should've turned around and left before the sun came up again
But the sun came up again
Enter the morning light
To find the day is burning the curtains and the wine
In a little white room
No I'm not alone, her head is heavy on me
She's sleeping like a child
What could I do?
You get in, you get done and then you get gone
You never leave a trace, or show your face, you get gone
Should've turned around and left before the sun came up again
But the sun came up again
I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
Little did I know that girl was an assassin too
Suddenly I'm in over my head and I can hardly breathe
Suddenly I'm floating over her bed and I feel everything
Suddenly I know exactly what I did, but I can not move a thing
And suddenly I know exactly what I'd done
And what it's going to mean to me, mean to me
I'm gone
I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
Little did I know that girl was an assassin too
She's an assassin
She's an assassin
She's an assassin
She's an assassin and she had a job to do"
16,Badge and Gun,https://genius.com/John-mayer-badge-and-gun-lyrics,Paradise Valley,True,"Give me my badge and gun
Give me the road that I may run
Give me that peaceful, wandering free I used to know
I've waited all I can
But I'm just not a patient man
And I've been hiding here for seven months or so
Hand me down my golden hat
And grab the winter one at that
You never know how long I'll be away
Give me my badge and gun
Give me the songs that I once sung
Give me those jet-black, kick-back, lay down nights alone
This house is safe and warm
But I was made to chase the storm
Taking the whole world on with big old empty arms
Tell my friends I tried my best
That one day I just up and left
They probably saw it coming anyway
What can I say
Hey, hey
The lock is on the cellar door
I can't remember what it's for
I ain't been down those stairs in oh so long
So, so long
The copy of your key is hanging where it used to be
Good as you've always been to me
The life I need to lead
Is somewhere out there, calling over those hills"
17,Belief,https://genius.com/John-mayer-belief-lyrics,Continuum,True,"Is there anyone who ever remembers
Changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls ever breaking rank, at all
For something someone yelled real loud, one time?
Oh, everyone believes
In how they think it ought to be
Oh, everyone believes
And they're not going easily
Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon for the war that's ragin' on inside
Oh, everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Oh, everyone believes
And no one's going quietly
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
Is there anyone you can remember
Ever surrendered with their life on the line?
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?
Belief can, belief can
What puts the folded flag inside his mother's hand?
Belief can, belief can"
18,Belief (live),https://genius.com/John-mayer-belief-live-lyrics,Continuum,True,"Is there anyone who

20,Bigger Than My Body,https://genius.com/John-mayer-bigger-than-my-body-lyrics,Heavier Things,True,"This is a call to the color-blind
This is an IOU
I'm stranded behind a horizon line
Tied up in something true
Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for
Why is it not my time
What is there more to learn
Shed this skin I've been tripping in
Never to quite return
Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for
Cause I'm bigger than my body now
Maybe I'll tangle in the power lines
And it might be over in a second's time
But I'll gladly go down in a flame
If a flame's what it takes to remember my name
To remember my name
Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
For my fuse to dry
Wait for my fuse to dry
Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body now"
25,Bold as Love,https://genius.com/John-mayer-bold-as-love-lyrics,Continuum,True,"Anger, he smiles
Towering in shiny, metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted
They quietly understand
The once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on
But they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
They're all bold as love
Just ask the axis
My red is so confident that he flashes
Trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go around
My yellow, in this case, is not so mellow
In fact, I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you
I'm bold, bold as love
Yeah I'm bold, bold as love
I'm bold, bold as love
Just ask the axis
Yeah he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows everything
I'm bold, bold as love
I'm bold, bold as love
Hear me talking to you
I'm bold, bold as love, yeah"
26,Born and Raised,https://genius.com/John-mayer-born-and-raised-lyrics,Born and Raised,True,"Now and then I pace my place
I can't retrace how I got here
I cheat the light to check my face
It's slightly harder than last year
But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely
I still have dreams, they’re not the same
They don’t fly as high as they used to
I saw my friend, he's in my head
And he said, “You don’t remember me do you?”
But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely
Still got time, still got faith
I call on both of my brothers
Got a mom, got a dad
But they do not have each other
So line on up and take your place
Show your face to the morning
Because one of these days you’ll be
Born and raised and it
All comes up without warning"
27,Born and Raised (Reprise),https://genius.com/John-mayer-born-and-raised-reprise-lyrics,Born and Raised,True,"One, two
One, two, three
Born and raised
Locks of brown, streaks of gray
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say, ""Now I'm born and raised""
Born and raised
In half the time I'll be twice my age
Better learn how to turn the page
Because time is strange when you're born and raised
Born and raised
Locks of brown, streaks of gray
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say, ""Now I'm born and raised"""
30,Call Me the Breeze,https://genius.com/John-mayer-call-me-the-breeze-lyrics,Paradise Valley,True,"They call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
They call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
I've got nobody
I'm carrying no load
There's no change in the weather
There's no change in me
There's no change in the weather
There's no change in me
I'm not hiding from nobody
Nobody’s hiding from me
I got that green light babe
I've got to keep moving on
I got that green light, babe
I've got to keep moving on
I might go up to California
Might go down to Georgia
I don’t know"
33,Changing,https://genius.com/John-mayer-changing-lyrics,The Search for Everything,True,"I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing
I met me someone changing
We had some fun changing
Sometimes I wonder if she'll be the one
When I am done changing
Some of us stopped running
Some of us went home
Some of us don’t got one
So we'll build one of our own
Friends behind their fences
Looking at me strange
Wondering when I’m gonna come to my senses
But I'm still changing
And I can’t change my ways
I see the sky changing
Reminds me of my changing
Wish I could tie me a rope 'round the sun
'Cause I am not done changing
Time's been talking to me
Whispering in my ear
Saying “Follow your heart
'Til it tears you apart”
But hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing
Changing
Changing"
34,City Love,https://genius.com/John-mayer-city-love-lyrics,Room for Squares,True,"I never liked this apple much
It always seemed too big to touch
I can't remember how I found
My way before she came around
I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name
She keeps a toothbrush at my place
As if I had the extra space
She steals my clothes to wear to work
I know her hairs are on my shirts
I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name
The day
She called up and came to me
Covered in rain
And dinnertime shadowing
And as her clothes spun, we spooned
And I knew I was through
When I said ""I love you""
Friday evening, we've been drinking
2 a.m., I swear I might propose
But we close the tab
Split a cab
And call each other up when we get home
Falling asleep to the sound
Of sirens
I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name
From the battery
To the gallery
It's the kind of thing you only see
In scented, glossy magazines
And I can't remember life before her name"
36,Clarity,https://genius.com/John-mayer-clarity-lyrics,Heavier Things,True,"I worry
I weigh three times my body
I worry
I throw my fear around
But this morning
There's a calm I can't explain
The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain
Ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo
By the time I recognize this moment
This moment will be gone
But I will bend the light pretending that it somehow lingered on
When all I got's
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will pay no mind
When it won't and it won't because it can't
It just can't
It's not supposed to
Was there a second of time that I looked around?
Did I sail through or drop my anchor down?
Was anything enough to kiss the ground
And say I'm here now?
And she is here now
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo
So much wasted in the afternoon
So much sacred in the month of June
How 'bout you, oh?
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever, yeah
And I will wait to find
That it won't and it won't
And it won't
And I will pay no mind
Worried 'bout no rainy weather
And I will waste no time
Remaining in our lives together"
39,Come Back to Bed,https://genius.com/John-mayer-come-back-to-bed-lyrics,Heavier Things,True,"Still is the life
Of your room when you're not inside
And all of your things
Tell the sweetest story line
Your tears on these sheets
And your footsteps are down the hall
So tell me what I did
I can't find where the moment went wrong at all
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed 
What will this fix?
You know you're not a quick forgive
And I won't sleep through this
I survive on the breath you are finished with
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
You can be mad in the morning
Or the afternoon instead
But don't leave me
Ninety-eight and six degrees of separation from you baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Why don't you come back to bed?
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love"
52,Crossroads,https://genius.com/John-mayer-crossroads-lyrics,Battle Studies,True,"I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord for mercy
Said, help me if you please
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
No one seemed to know me, everybody passed me by
You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willy Brown
You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willy Brown
That I'm standing at the crossroads
I believe I'm sinking down"
53,Daughters,https://genius.com/John-mayer-daughters-lyrics,Heavier Things,True,"I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart
On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the God and the weight of her world
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too"

Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be?

Can you show me what I still can’t see?
Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Now I wonder what you think
When you see me on the magazine
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
Some county judge in Ohio is all I ever find
Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?
Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?
Well I’ve got my dream, but you’ve got a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but you’ve got yourself a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but I guess it got away from me"
60,Do You Know Me,https://genius.com/John-mayer-do-you-know-me-lyrics,Battle Studies,True,"It's just the strangest thing
I've seen your face somewhere
An early evening dream, a past life love affair

A feather in my hand
A flower in your hair
Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?"
61,Dreaming With a Broken Heart,https://genius.com/John-mayer-dreaming-with-a-broken-heart-lyrics,Continuum,True,"When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part
You roll out of bed and down on your knees
And for a moment, you can hardly breathe
Wondering, “Was she really here?
Is she standing in my room?”
No she’s not
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The giving up is the hardest part
She takes you in, with her crying eyes
Then, all at once, you have to say goodbye
Wondering, “could you stay my love?
Will you wake up by my side?”
No she can’t
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my, roses in my hands?
And would you get them if I did?
No you won’t
‘Cause you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part"
62,Edge of Desire,https://genius.com/John-mayer-edge-of-desire-lyrics,Battle Studies,True,"Young and full of running
Tell me where has that taken me
Just a great figure eight or a tiny infinity
Love is really nothing
But a dream that keeps waking me
For all of my trying, we still end up dying
How can it be
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
Because I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me
So young and full of running
All the way to the edge of desire
Steady my breathing, silently screaming
I have to have you now
Wired and I'm tired
Think I'll sleep in my clothes on the floor
Or maybe this mattress will spin on its axis
And find me on yours
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
Because I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me"

You don't have to try so hard
To hurt me

Your heart is where my head should be
The dissonance is killing me

Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave

It's raining on the mission bell
They're draining out the wishing well

Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on
I rose in you like morning light
And sheltered you asleep at night
It breaks my heart
It takes all the love I have to say
I know we're gonna be ok
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
Until it's gone"

It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you

Because I must confess to you
Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you

Twice it's shame on me

68,"Friends, Lovers or Nothing",https://genius.com/John-mayer-friends-lovers-or-nothing-lyrics,Battle Studies,True,"Now that we are over as the loving kind
We'll be dreaming ways to keep the good alive
Only when we want is not a compromise
I'd be pouring tears into your drying eyes
Friends, lovers or nothing
There can only be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
There will never be an in-between, so give it up
You whisper, come on over
Cause you're two drinks in
But in the morning, I will say goodbye again
Think we'll never fall into the jealous game
The streets are flood with blood of those who felt the same
Friends, lovers or nothing
There can only be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
There will never be an in-between, so give it up
Friends, lovers, or nothing
We can really only ever be one
Friends, lovers, or nothing
We'll never be the inbetween
So give it up
We'll never the inbetween
So give it up
Anything other than 'yes' is 'no'
Anything other than 'stay' is 'go'
Anything less than 'I love you' is lying..."
73,Gravity,https://genius.com/John-mayer-gravity-lyrics,Continuum,True,"Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, I'll never know
What makes this man, with all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away
Woah, woah
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees
Woah, woah
Gravity, stay the hell away from me
Woah, woah

Just keep me where the light is

Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where, now, keep me where the light is"
75,Great Indoors,https://genius.com/John-mayer-great-indoors-lyrics,Room for Squares,True,"Check your pulse
It's proof that you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days
Scared of a world outside you should go explore
Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
The great indoors
Lamplight makes the shadows play
And posters take the walls away
The TV is your window pane
The view won't let you down
So put your faith in a late night show
I bet you didn't even know
Depends on how far out you go
The channel numbers change
Scared of a world outside you should go explore
Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
The great indoors
Though lately I can't blame you
I have seen the world
And sometimes wish your room had room for two
So go unlock the door
And find what you are here for
Leave the great indoors
Leave the great indoors
Check your pulse
It's proof that you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days"
76,Half of My Heart,https://genius.com/John-mayer-half-of-my-heart-lyrics,Battle Studies,True,"I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you 
Oh, with half of my heart
I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you 
Oh, with half of my heart
Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you with half of my
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart’s got a real cool imagination
Half of my heart’s got you
Half of my heart’s got the right mind to tell you
Half of my heart won’t do
Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart"
77,Heartbreak Warfare,https://genius.com/John-mayer-heartbreak-warfare-lyrics,Battle Studies,True,"Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?
Verse 
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?
How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all
It's a heart, heartbreak
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God, we're going to get it right
If you lay your weapon down
Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak, heartbreak
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare"

81,Home Life,https://genius.com/John-mayer-home-life-lyrics,Heavier Things,True,"I think I'm going to stay home
Have myself a home life
Sitting in the slow-mo
And listening to the daylight
I am not a nomad
I am not a rocket man
I was born a house cat
By the slight of my mother's hand
I think I'm going to stay home
I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I used to be in my M-Z now
You'll never find me 'cause my name isn't there
Home life
Been holding out for a home life
My whole life
I want to see the end game
I want to learn her last name
Finish on a Friday
And sit in traffic on the highway
See, I refuse to believe
That my life's going to be
Just some string of incompletes
Never to lead me to anything remotely close to a home life
Been holding out for a home life
My whole life
I can tell you this much
II will marry just once
And if it doesn't work out
Give her half of my stuff
It's fine with me
We said eternity
And I will go to my grave
With the life that I gave
Not just some melody line
On a radio wave
It dissipates
And soon evaporates
But home life doesn't change 
I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I'd love to walk to where we both can talk, but
I've got to leave you cause my ride is here
In my home life
You take the home life
You keep the home life
I'll come back for the home life
I promise
Home life I promise
Life
Home life
Home life"

And set it free
Free
If I ever get around to living
I'll take the end of every day
Tie it up to every morning
And sail away
Away
Free
Free

I don't have tattoos
And very soon, mother will be calling me
Saying, ""Come upstairs, you've got some work to do""

Searching for a sign
That's never going to look the way you want it

When are you going to wise up boy?

You got me crying, as was your plan
But when my loneliness is through
I'm going to find another you
You take your sweaters
You take your time
You might have your reasons
But you will never have my rhyme
I'm going to sing my way away from blue
I'm going to find another you
When I was your lover
No one else would do
If I'm forced to find another
I hope she looks like you
Yeah and she's nicer too
So go on baby
Make your little get away
My pride will keep me company
And you just gave yours all away

Once for me and once for someone new

Oh

Can he do to you the things that I do

Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

Baby do you know and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my skull
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire

I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
Stood on the corner for a while
To wait for the wind to blow down on me
Hoping it takes with it my old ways
And brings some brand new luck upon me
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
And now I'm walking in a park
All of the birds they dance below me
Maybe when things turn green again
It will be good to say you know me
Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady

How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?
How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?
How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?

Somedays, I think it's all okay
Some nights, I throw it all away

Keep on riding until I see that dawn

That you wonder what you still believe in
And you can't remember why you said goodbye
You'll hear an old familiar sound and hope it's her when you turn around
But never, never on the day you leave
Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything
No it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it's gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never, never on the day you leave
Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell
Then force herself to like some other man
No it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store Christmas tree
But never, never on the day you leave
No never, never on the day you leave
So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says maybe we're not perfect
But I'll be damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave"

Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule
Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been
Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't they remind you of just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess
Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule
Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me

I wear a new cologne and
You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed
I know what you'll say
This won't last longer than the rest of the day
But you're wrong this time
You're wrong
Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
I'm over the analyzing tonight
Stop trying to figure it out
Deep will only bring you down

The back porch poet with my book of rhymes
Always open knowing all the time I'm probably
Never going to find the perfect rhyme

But just remember on the way home
That you were never meant to feel alone
It takes a little while, but you'd be fine
Another good time coming down the line
You'll go back to love that's waiting
I'll unpack in a rented room
How's that life you swear you're hating
Grass is greener: that makes two
Life isn't short, but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all
Life isn't short, but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all
It don't come often, and it don't stay long
But just remember on the way home
That you don't ever have to feel alone
Just stay on the run, get off the grid
Hide yourself out like you know that I did
And if you might find that you're running is done
A little bit of Heaven never hurt no one"
157,Paper Doll,https://genius.com/John-mayer-paper-doll-lyrics,Paradise Valley,True,"Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here’s a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you
This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing
You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll
Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda' kept my undershirt
You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll
Cut the cord and pull some strings
Make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don’t fly
Someone’s going to paint you another sky
'Cause you’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall?
Was it just too far to fall?"
158,Perfectly Lonely,https://genius.com/John-mayer-perfectly-lonely-lyrics,Battle Studies,True,"Had a little love, but I spread it thin
Falling in her arms and out again
Made a bad name for my game around town
Tore up my heart, and shut it down
Nothing to do
Nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do
No one but me
And that's all I need
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely 
Because I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me
I see friends around from time to time
When their ladies let them slip away
And when they ask me how I'm doing with mine
This is always what I say
Nothing to do
Nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do
No one but me
And that's all I need
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely 
Because I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me
And this is not to say
There never comes a day
I'll take my chances and start again
And when I look behind
On all my younger times
I have to thank the wrongs that led me to a love so strong
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely 
Cause I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it

Goodbye sorrow, and goodbye shame
I'm headed out west with my headphones on
Boarded a flight with a song in the back of my soul
And no one knows
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down
Hello beauty, hello strange
Hello wonder, what's your name?
Looking for the Sun that Neil Young hung
After the Gold Rush of 1971
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down
If you see her, say hello
Just don't tell me, I told you so
Joni wrote ""Blue"" in her house by the sea
I've got to believe there's another color waiting on me
To set me free
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down"

The one that you had eyes for

Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light

Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home
The last ten texts were with your ex
And all of 'em were sent by you
But you keep starin' at your phone like something's comin' through
Come to grips and take your chips when the cards aren't goin' your way
You've been here so long tonight's already yesterday
Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home
Roll it on home

Just like you found yourself before
Like I found myself in pieces
On the hotel floor
Hard times help me see
I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
Well I'm no trouble maker
And I never meant her harm
But it doesn’t mean I didn’t make it
Hard to carry on
Well it sucks to be honest 
And it hurts to be real
But it's nice to make some love
That I can finally feel
Hard times let me be
I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start

We pulled too many false alarms
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch, because you can
You try to hit me, just to hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
'Cause you can't understand
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed

Wondering when the call comes
When you say it's alright
You got your heart right
Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
All you need is love is a lie 'cause
We had love but we still said goodbye
Now we're tired, battered fighters
And it stings when it's nobody's fault
'Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name
It's only the air you took and the breath you left
So maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
So I check the weather wherever you are
'Cause I want to know if you can see the stars tonight
It might be my only right
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness
I called
Because
I just
Need to feel you on the line
Don't hang up this time
And I know it was me who called it over but
I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day
Don't let me get away
'Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me
So I can say this is the way that I used to be
There's no substitute for time
Or for the sadness
Split screen sadness
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness

I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?
Don't know how else to say it
Don't want to see my parents go
One generation's length away
From fighting life out on my own
Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?
So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find a way to say that life has just begun
Had a talk with my old man
Said, ""Help me understand""
He said, ""Turn 68, you'll renegotiate""
""Don't stop this train
Don't, for a minute, change the place you're in
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John, honestly, we'll never stop this train""
Once in a while, when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And they're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
'Til you cry when you're driving away in the dark
Singing, ""Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in

And find a love to call your own

Your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue
Who knows what will be
But I'll make you this guarantee, see
No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors
I'm learning you
And when it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky
Like children do
I'll say to you
No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day
We should take a ride tonight around the town
And look around at all the beautiful houses
Something in the way that blue lights on a black night
Can make you feel more
Everybody, it seems to me, just wants to be
Just like you and me
Hey, hey
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?

They say we stand for nothing and

With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it
So we keep waiting

When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Because when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want
That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Can you love me all the way?
Will you tie me tight in little strands of paradise?
Will you walk with me before the morning fades?

Come back in our home

You know the next is up to you
And his wife told his kids he was crazy
And his friends said he'd fail if he'd try
But with the will to work hard
And a library card
He took a homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride
That morning
The sea was mad and I mean it
Waves as big as he'd seen it
Deep in his dreams at home
From dry land
He rolled it over to wet sand
Closed the hatch up with one hand
And peddled off alone
Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And for once in his life it was quiet
As he learned how to turn in the tide
And the sky was a flare
As he came up for air
In his homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride
One evening
When weeks had passed since he's leaving
The call she planned on receiving
Finally made it home
She accepted
The news she never expected
The operator connected
The call from Tokyo
Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
Now his friends bring him up when they're drinking
At the bar with his name on the side
And they smile when they can
As they speak of the man
Who took a homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride"
212,War of My Life,https://genius.com/John-mayer-war-of-my-life-lyrics,Battle Studies,True,"Come out angels, come out ghosts
Come out darkness, bring everyone you know
I'm not running, and I'm not scared
I am waiting, and well prepared
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
I got a hammer, and a heart of glass
I got to know right now, which walls to smash
I got to pocket, got no pills
If fear hasn't killed me yet, then nothing will
All the suffering
And all the pain
Never left a name
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
No more suffering
No more pain
Never again
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
So fight on 
Fight on, everyone 
Fight on, got no choice but to fight until it's done 
So fight on
So fight on 
Fight on, everyone 
Fight on, got no choice but to fight until it's done 
So fight on"
213,Wheel,https://genius.com/John-mayer-wheel-lyrics,Heavier Things,True,"People have the right to fly
And will when it gets compromised
Their hearts say ""move along""
Their minds say ""gotcha heart""
""Let's move it along""
Move it along
And airports see it all the time
Where someone's last goodbye
Blends in with someone's sigh
Cause someone's coming home
In hand a single rose
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And I won't be the last
No, I won't be the last
To love her
And you can't build a house of leaves
And live like it's an evergreen
It's just a season thing
It's just this thing that seasons do
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And you won't be the first
No, you won't be the first
To love me
You can find me
If you ever want again
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around, I'll be around
And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
You just might find if you give it time, you will wave hello again
You just might wave hello again
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
I believe 
That my life's going to see 
The love I give return to me 
I believe 
That my life's going to see 
The love I give return to me
I believe
That my life's going to see the love I give return to me"
215,"Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey",https://genius.com/John-mayer-whiskey-whiskey-whiskey-lyrics,Born and Raised,True,"We pick up in New York City
I'm tryna find a man I never got to be
But when I push down on the pavement
I found the whole thing so much harder than it seemed
The only deal I ever signed
No devil drew a dotted line
The stage was set, the words were mine
I'm not complaining
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go
Every night around this time
My friends and I, we treat it like a race
When I really start to break it down
I wouldn't trust a girl who knew about this place
Barking on with no one left
Speak softly underneath my breath
""Hey world, you ain't seen nothing yet""
Great, now it's raining
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Dreamed somebody missed me
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
And repeat and repeat after me
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Cut me off and pour me in the street"
217,Who Says,https://genius.com/John-mayer-who-says-lyrics,Battle Studies,True,"Who says I can’t get stoned?
Turn off the lights and the telephone
Me, in my house alone
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Who says I can’t be free?
From all of the things that I used to be
Re-write my history
Who says I can’t be free?
It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Baton Rouge
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again, I don’t remember you
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Call up a girl that I used to know
Fake love for an hour or so
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Who says I can’t take time?
Meet all the girls on the county line
Wait on fate to send a sign
Who says I can’t take time?
It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Austin too
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again, I don’t remember you
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Plan a trip to Japan alone
Doesn’t matter if I even go
Who says I can’t get stoned?
It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long time since 22
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again I don’t remember, don't remember you"
218,Who You Love,https://genius.com/John-mayer-who-you-love-lyrics,Paradise Valley,True,"You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
My girl, she isn't the one
I saw coming
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I tried to run before
But I'm not running anymore
Because I've fought against it hard enough to know
That you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love
My boy ain't the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart's too hard to hold
And it takes a little time
But you should see him when he shines
You never want to let that feeling go
When you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
Yeah, you love, who you love
Who you love
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love
Oh you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love
It's who you love
Who you love
Who you love
Who you love
You're the one I love"
219,Why Georgia,https://genius.com/John-mayer-why-georgia-lyrics,Room for Squares,True,"I am driving up '85 in the
Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
Just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind
Because I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?
I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul
Either way--I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?
So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down
Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay
Still ""everything happens for a reason""
Is no reason not to ask myself
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why? Tell me why?
Why? Why Georgia, why?"
223,Wildfire,https://genius.com/John-mayer-wildfire-lyrics,Paradise Valley,True,"River's strong, you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Because a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about
You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Hasn't it been some kind of day?
You and me been catching on like a wildfire
Don't get up, just to
Get another, you can
Drink from mine, we can't
Leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head on my shoulder
If you want to get older with me
Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history
I got a rock from the river
In my medicine bag
Magpie feather
In his medicine bag"
224,Wildfire Interlude,https://genius.com/John-mayer-wildfire-interlude-lyrics,Paradise Valley,True,"Only a nascent trying to harness huge fire
Out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Burning trees in the basement start a cool fire
Feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Back in Paris you told me you were suicidal
It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel
You're gorgeous but you can't fly
A hidden admirer sent me roses white as fire
We took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire"
227,Your Body Is a Wonderland,https://genius.com/John-mayer-your-body-is-a-wonderland-lyrics,Room for Squares,True,"We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue
And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it
You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again, again
I'll use my hands)
Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes
Your body is a wonderland 
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland 
Your body is a wonderland "
232,You’re Gonna Live Forever in Me,https://genius.com/John-mayer-youre-gonna-live-forever-in-me-lyrics,The Search for Everything,True,"A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see
Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea
And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny
Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be
And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see"
233,You’re No One ’Til Someone Lets You Down,https://genius.com/John-mayer-youre-no-one-til-someone-lets-you-down-lyrics,Paradise Valley,True,"No, I've not seen you this way before
Standing a mess at my door
Well, it took you so long
But you finally found
You're no one until someone lets you down
You believed that all people are kind
And that you'd never mess with your mind
You gave her your trust
And she busted your crown
You're no one until someone lets you down
Yes, I've been told
That some people grow old
Without losing a part of their soul
But if that is true
I don't wish it on you
There's so much to adore in a heart that is blue
There's a light in your eyes that is pure
That you won't give away anymore
But just think of the things
We can talk about now
You're no one until someone lets you down
Yes, I have heard
There are some that avoid
All the pain that will come with the fall
But if that's the case
It would surely erase
All the joy that you feel
When the hurt fades away
There's a heart ticket train on the way
Waitin' to take you away
Will you please keep in mind
When it pulls into town
You're no one until someone lets you down
You're no one until someone lets you down"
