9,Back Home,https://genius.com/Owl-city-back-home-lyrics,Mobile Orchestra,True,"I'm saying goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fireflies
Pack your bags it's time to go
Cause we got brighter lights back home
I've got aching feet
From walking over miles of concrete
And I can't wait to dream
But the city, you know she won't go to sleep
So I'm saying...
Goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fireflies
Pack your bags it's time to go
Cause we got brighter lights back home
Yeah, we got brighter lights back home
Back home there's a girl named Mary Lou
A diner off the highway with a corner booth
And every gravel road is a trip down memory lane
And back home, where the corn grows ten feet tall
Every year's measured on the pantry wall
The willow trees are waving 'til we come back home again
]
I'm saying goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
(To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fireflies
Pack your bags it's time to go)
Pack your bags it's time to go
 Together]
I'm saying goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
To free time and starry nights
Pack your bags it's time to go
Pack your bags it's time to go"
14,Bird with a Broken Wing,https://genius.com/Owl-city-bird-with-a-broken-wing-lyrics,Mobile Orchestra,True,"So I walk alone down the darkest roads
Cause I've always known how the story goes
When the curtain falls I'll be wearing thin
Clawing at the walls as they're closing in
In this twisted plot I was destined for
I'm an astronaut on the ocean floor
So misunderstood 'till the bloody end
How I wish I could do it all again
It feels like I'm a lone survivor
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
It's do or die, and this is mine
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
It's another night of the living dead
Like a viper bite in a spiderweb
It's so deathly dark in the alleyway
And a bleeding heart makes you easy prey
I would run and hide for the afternoon
With the butterfly in the panic room
Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time
For a different twist in the story line
It feels like I'm a lone survivor
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
It's do or die, and this is mine
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
It feels like I'm a lone survivor
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
It's do or die, and this is mine
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
Tell the world I know that my mind is made
It's a horror show, but I'm not afraid
Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time
For a different twist in the story line"
15,Bombshell Blonde,https://genius.com/Owl-city-bombshell-blonde-lyrics,The Midsummer Station,True,"That blonde, she's a bomb, she's an atom bomb
Rigged up, and ready to drop!
Bad news, I'm a fuse, and I've met my match
So stand back, it's about to go off!
That vixen, she's a master of disguise!
I see danger, when I look in her eyes
She's so foxy, she could lead to my demise
So I'm running, cause I've run out of time
She’s a bombshell blonde, wired up to detonate!
I’m James Bond, live to die another day!
Bombshell blonde, high explosive dynamite!
She’s all I want so I, I’m on a mission tonight!
Her love is a drug laced with ecstasy
And her charm is spiked with a spell
A hot mess in a dress gets the best of me
She's ice cold, but she's making me melt!
That vixen, she's a master of disguise!
I see danger, when I look in her eyes
She's so foxy, she could lead to my demise
So I'm running, cause I've run out of time
She’s a bombshell blonde, wired up to detonate!
I’m James Bond, live to die another day!
Bombshell blonde, high explosive dynamite!
She’s all I want so I, I’m on a mission tonight!
That vixen, she's a master of disguise!

She's so foxy, she could lead to my demise
So I'm running, cause I've run out of time
She’s a bombshell blonde, wired up to detonate!
I’m James Bond, live to die another day!
Bombshell blonde, high explosive dynamite!
She’s all I want so I, I’m on a mission tonight!
That vixen, she's a master of disguise!
I see danger, when I look in her eyes
She's so foxy, she could lead to my demise

17,Butterfly Wings,https://genius.com/Owl-city-butterfly-wings-lyrics,Ocean Eyes,True,"If I was a raindrop
Would you be my thunderstorm?
It's cold so surround me
With rain clouds to keep me warm
I feel like I'm falling
So darling don't let me go
The thought is appalling but should I slip away
Into the stormy sea will you remember me?
Asleep in our warm cocoons
We dream of lovely things
We're both gonna wake up soon
So we hope that tomorrow brings
Us our butterfly wings
If I was a grain of sand
Would you be Miami Beach?
So dusty with starlight
Close your eyes and cuddle close to me
I'll try not to wake you
Or make a sound while you're dozing off
But in the night should the high tides
Sweep me away from you
Tell me again my dear will you be waiting here?
Whenever we leave the ground
And take to the sky
I'll smile as I'm gazing down
Because I've always wondered why
We won't need feathers to fly"
18,Can’t Live Without You,https://genius.com/Owl-city-cant-live-without-you-lyrics,Mobile Orchestra,True,"All the thoughts in my head spin around like a hurricane
And life leaves me so confused
When I trip and I fall I collapse like a tidal wave
So I'm crying out to You
You reached down out of nowhere
And picked my heart up off the floor
You put my life back together
And I'm not broken anymore
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: ""Will You come to my rescue?""
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without You
I can't live without You
I just can't live without You
When I'm hit like a hook to the jaw in a title fight
I'm down and I'm knocked out cold, you know
And with my heart broke apart like a wreck in a shallow tide
Yeah I've never felt this low
You reached down out of nowhere
And picked my heart up off the floor
You put my life back together
And I'm not broken anymore
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: ""Will You come to my rescue?""
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I just can't live without you
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: ""Will You come to my rescue?""
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without You
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: ""Will you come to my rescue?""
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without You"
20,Cave In,https://genius.com/Owl-city-cave-in-lyrics,Ocean Eyes,True,"Please take a long hard look
Through your text book cause I'm history
When I strap my helmet on I'll be long gone
'Cause I've been dying to leave
Yeah, I'll ride the range
And hide all my loose change in my bedroll
'Cause riding a dirt bike down a turnpike
Always takes its toll on me
I've had just about enough
Of quote diamonds in the rough
Because my backbone is paper thin
Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
If the bombs go off the sun will still be shining
Because I've heard it said that
Every mushroom cloud has a silver lining
Swallow a drop of gravel and blacktop
'Cause the road tastes like Wintergreen
The wind and the rain smell of oil and octane
Mixed with stale gasoline
I'll soak up the sound
Try to sleep on the wet ground
I'll get ten minutes give or take
'Cause I just don't foresee myself getting drowsy
When cold integrity keeps me wide awake
Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
I'll keep my helmet on
Just in case my head caves in
'Cause if my thoughts collapse
Or my framework snaps
It'll make a mess like you wouldn't believe
Tie my handlebars to the stars
So I stay on track 
And if my intentions stray I'll wrench them away
Then I'll take my leave and I won't even look back
I won't even look back
(Da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da daaa...)"
26,Dementia,https://genius.com/Owl-city-dementia-lyrics,The Midsummer Station,True,"Dementia, you're driving me crazy
This is driving me crazy
Dementia, oh, dementia
Every light in the night flickered in and out
Every bone in my back shivered up and down
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
Cause this is driving me crazy
Every voice in my head shouted yes and no
Every freight train of thought fought to stop and go
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
Cause this is driving me crazy
Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight
Rub your eyes, you're a star in a summer night
This is love, this is war, it's insanity
Dementia, you're driving me crazy
Every tear in my eyes dripped and wouldn't drop
Every disc in my spine shook and couldn't stop
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
Cause this is driving me crazy
Every hand let me go that I tried to hold
Every warm-hearted love left me freezing cold
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
Cause this is driving me crazy
Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight
Rub your eyes, you're a star in a summer night
This is love, this is war, it's insanity
Dementia, you're driving me crazy
Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight
Rub your eyes, you're a star in a summer night
This is love, this is war, it's insanity
Dementia, oh, dementia
Through the skies you're en route at the speed of light
So realize there's chaos in the air tonight
This is love, this is war, this is pure insanity
Dementia, you're driving me crazy
This is driving me crazy
Oh, dementia, you're driving me crazy"
27,Dental Care,https://genius.com/Owl-city-dental-care-lyrics,Ocean Eyes,True,"I brush my teeth, and look in the mirror
And laugh out loud as I'm beaming from ear to ear
I'd rather pick flowers, instead of fights
And rather than flaunt my style
I'd flash you a smile, of clean pearly whites
I've been to the dentist a thousand times so I know the drill
I smooth my hair, sit back in the chair
But somehow I still get the chills
""Have a seat"" he says pleasantly
As he shakes my hand, and practically laughs at me
""Open up nice and wide"" he says peering in
And with a smirk he says ""Don't have a fit, this'll just pinch a bit""
As he tries not to grin
When hygienists leave on long vacations
That's when dentists scream and lose their patience
Talking only brings the toothaches on
Because I say the stupidest things
So if my resolve goes South
I'll swallow my pride with an aspirin, and shut my mouth
Golf and alcohol don't mix
And that's why I don't drink and drive
Because, good grief I'd knock out my teeth
And have to kiss my smile goodbye
I've been to the dentist a thousand times so I know the drill
I smooth my hair, sit back in the chair
But somehow I still get the chills"
29,Dreams and Disasters,https://genius.com/Owl-city-dreams-and-disasters-lyrics,The Midsummer Station,True,"We were alone on the road, driving faster
So far from home, we were chasing disaster
Hard on the gas, 'til the car caught on fire
We had to laugh, as the smoke billowed higher
I want to feel alive forever after
And you say, you say you want to feel alive forever after
And I, and I, and I say
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ight through the dreams and disasters
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ight to the edge and the after
We won't turn around
We will not slow down
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ight through the dreams and disasters
Think of the sun and the sound of it rising
Still on the run with our eyes on the horizon
I want to feel alive forever after
And you say, you say you want to feel alive forever after
And I, and I, and I say
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ght through the dreams and disasters
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ght to the edge and the after
We won't turn around
We will not slow down
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ght through the dreams and disasters
I just want to feel alive
I just want to feel alive
I just want to feel alive
I just want to feel alive
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ght through the dreams and disasters

32,Embers,https://genius.com/Owl-city-embers-lyrics,The Midsummer Station,True,"There were days when each hour
Was a war I fought to survive
There were nights full of nightmares
And I dreaded closing my eyes
There were skies that burst open
With a downpour to drown me alive
But the world took a spark like a match in the dark
And the fire brought me to life
So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high
Because there's no other way we can stay alive
Because we're burning bright as we all unite
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun
So don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light
And though the embers are new, whatever you do
Just don't let the fire die
And you'll find, there'll be mornings
When the ashes and embers are cold
But you'll fight with a passion
And you'll never stop cause you know
Yeah you know it gets better
And your story is yet to be told
Every push, every shove, every war, every love
Yeah the coals are beginning to glow
Don't let the fire die
It gets better
Just don't let the fire die, no
And though the embers are new, whatever you do
Just don't let the fire die
Don't let the fire die"
37,Fireflies,https://genius.com/Owl-city-fireflies-lyrics,Ocean Eyes,True,"You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems 
Leave my door open just a crack
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep 
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell 
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar

46,Hello Seattle (Ocean Eyes Version),https://genius.com/Owl-city-hello-seattle-ocean-eyes-version-lyrics,Ocean Eyes,True,"Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer
In the hills and highlands
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
And awake in your mouth
Hello Seattle, I am a manta ray
Deep beneath the blue waves
I'll crawl the sandy bottom of Puget Sound
And construct a summer home
Hello Seattle, I am the crescent moon
Shining down on your face
I will disguise myself as a sleeping pill
And descend inside of you
Hello Seattle, I am a cold seahorse
Feeling warm in your sand
I sing about the tide and the ocean surf
Rolling in the evening breeze
Hello Seattle, I am an albatross
On the docks and moored boats
I sail above your inlets and interstates
Through the rain and open wind
Hello Seattle, I am an old lighthouse
Throwing beams of bright light
Red in the morning, blue in the evening sun
Taking heed for everyone

So, hey Anna, smile when he’s holding your hand tonight
Hey Anna, remember when you’re wishing away your life
Hey, hey Anna, everything is going to turn out just fine
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Such a hot crush
Makes your face blush
But try to take your time
Because every goose chase
Makes your heart race
And then you wonder why?
So wait for the home run
You’ll find the right one
And you’ll figure this all out
Life is a mind game
Love is a blind date
And it’s making your heart pound
Waking up sad
Isn’t so bad
If you look outside
Because all the signs say
That it’s a new day
And you were so alive
Life is a mind game
Love is a blind date
And it’s making your heart pound

55,Hot Air Balloon,https://genius.com/Owl-city-hot-air-balloon-lyrics,Ocean Eyes,True,"We wrote a prelude, to our own fairytale
And bought a parachute, at a church rummage sale
And with a mean sewing machine and miles of thread
We sewed the day above L.A., in navy and red
We wound a racetrack, through your mom's kitchen chairs
And fought the shadows back, down your dark basement stairs
I lit a match and let it catch, to light up the room
And then you yelled as we beheld
An old maroon hot air balloon
I'll be out of my mind
And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon
Leave your jacket behind
Lean out and touch the tree tops over town
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
We drank the great lakes
Like cold lemonade
And both got stomach aches
Sprawled out in the shade
So bored to death, you held your breath
And I tried not to yawn
You make my frown turn upside down
And now my worries are gone
I'll be out of my mind
And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon
Leave your jacket behind
Lean out and touch the tree tops over town

61,If My Heart Was A House,https://genius.com/Owl-city-if-my-heart-was-a-house-lyrics,Ocean Eyes,True,"You're the sky that I fell through
And I remember the view whenever I'm holding you
The sun hung from a string
Looking down on the world as it warms over everything
Chills run down my spine as our fingers entwine
And your sighs harmonize with mine
Unmistakably, I can still feel your heart
Beat fast when you dance with me
We got older and I should've known
That I'd feel colder when I walk alone
So I may as well ditch my dismay
Bombs away
Bombs away
Circle me and the needle moves gracefully back and forth
If my heart was a compass, you'd be north
Risk it all 'cause I'll catch you if you fall
Wherever you go, if my heart was a house, you'd be home
It makes me smile because you said it best
I would clearly feel blessed if the sun rose up from the West
Flower balm perfume, all my clothes smell like you
'Cause your favorite shade is navy blue
I walk slowly when I'm on my own
Yeah, but frankly I still feel alone
So I may as well ditch my dismay
Bombs away
Bombs away
Circle me and the needle moves gracefully back and forth
If my heart was a compass, you'd be north
Risk it all '​cause I'll catch you if you fall
Wherever you go, if my heart was a house, you'd be home

It was all a blur but there you were
And your love left me breathless
When the fairy dust fell over us
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love
So take my hand, and shed a tear
Before I'm gone, it's now or never
I'll hold you close, the end is near
But love goes on and on forever
It's so dark in my mind
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm so bad, at goodbyes
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
I don't have a lot left
Oh, how did it end so fast?
I say, with my last breath
It's a perfect day, to float away
When the sparks, flew between us
I saw you glow, and had to know
Where our journey would lead us
'Til the story end, and back again
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love
So lead me home, and lift me up
Above the stars, and even higher
I'm not afraid, because your love
It falls like rain, and burns like fire
It's so dark in my mind
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm so bad, at goodbyes
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
I don't have a lot left
Oh, how did it end so fast?

It's a perfect day to float away

63,I Hope You Think of Me,https://genius.com/Owl-city-i-hope-you-think-of-me-lyrics,The Midsummer Station,True,"She wound a thread around the pieces of my broken heart
And left me to believe
That girls don't want to, girls don't want to leave
A starry night without a fear of heights
I can't recall, Because I learned after all
That girls don't want to, girls don't want to fall
As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn
As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me
Da da da da da da daaaaa
Da da da da da da daaaaa 
I miss the way she whispered in my ear
Before she left, had me so convinced
That girls don't want to, girls don't want to leave
And Juliet's romantic balcony
Wears out the wall, but I learned after all
That girls don't want to, girls don't want to fall
As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn
As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me
When you're alone
I hope my ghost never leaves
Because when I'm home
Your painful memory is always haunting me
As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn
As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, the thought is killing me
When I see you around, my eyes go wide
When you race through my mind, I die inside
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me
 
Da da da da da da daaaaa
I hope you think of me"

Calling all cars there's an officer down
Shot to the heart on a night on the town
And the evidence of your fingerprints was found and now
You got the right to remain right here with me
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit
Love is a high-speed chase racing down the street
I'm coming after you
I'm coming after you
I'm coming after you
Oh, no here we go once again
We both know you'll never turn yourself in
So I'm driving till it's light out
Searching for your hide-out
(Driving till it's light out
Searching for your hide-out)
Pick up the pace as I chase you around
One of these days I'll end up tracking you down
But, yeah, I got the feeling I'll be letting you loose when I do

Taxi down the street, get out and use my feet
Don't matter much to me what it is that I do
As long as I'm coming home with you
Oh oh oh, as far as I can see
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me
Like a hijacked plane, or a runaway train
Or a speeding bullet, there's no stopping this
I left my heart in Metropolis
A thousand miles feels like a million years
Like hundreds of postcards that say I wish you were here
Airplane through the sky, greyhound racing by
Dirt bike on the beach, sailboat on the sea
Don't matter much to me what it is that I do
As long as I'm coming home with you
I left my heart in Metropolis!

That is the question
It refused to stay as it all turned grey
William Shakespeare's receding hair
Please excuse the pun
'It's hair today, gone tomorrow'
So I'll be thankful
For what precious locks you have
Toupee or not toupee
That is the question
And by the way I just got to say
Thank the Lord I'm not going bald
And if I may quip
My curls and I
Are just like heaven
'Cause rest assured
There'll be no parting there
But should my head get bare like Friar Tuck
It makes me smile
'Cause I know just what I'd do
Yeah if I had more wigs than I knew what to do with
I'd open a second hand store
And if you ever went bald
You'd recall it
'Cause I'd cleverly call it

91,Shooting Star,https://genius.com/Owl-city-shooting-star-lyrics,The Midsummer Station,True,"Close your tired eyes, relax and then
Count from 1 to 10 and open them
All these heavy thoughts will try to weigh you down, but not this time
Way up in the air, you're finally free
And you can stay up there, right next to me
All this gravity will try to pull you down, but not this time
When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are
Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are tonight
Woah, woah, woah
Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are, tonight
Gaze into my eyes, when the fire starts
And fan the flame so hot, it melt our hearts
All the pouring rain, will try to put it out, but not this time
Let your colors burn, and brightly burst
Into a million sparks that all disperse
And illuminate a world that'll try to bring you down, but not this time
When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are
Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are tonight
Woah, woah, woah
Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are, tonight
A thousand heartbeats beat in time
And makes this dark planet come alive
So when the lights flicker out tonight, you gotta shine
When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are
Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light

'cause I can't put to bed these phobias and fears
I'm new to this grief I can't explain
But I'm no stranger to the heartache and the pain
The fire I began, is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die
I'm a Silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever feel again?
I'm a Silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home
I'm sick of the past I can't erase
A jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't retrace
The mountain of things that I still regret
Is a vile reminder that I would rather just forget
The fire I began, is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die
I'm a Silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever smile again?
I'm a Silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home
'cause I walk alone
No matter where I go
'cause I walk alone
No matter where I go
'cause I walk alone
No matter where I go
I'm a Silhouette asking every now and then 
Is it over yet? Will I ever love again?

98,Strawberry Avalanche,https://genius.com/Owl-city-strawberry-avalanche-lyrics,Ocean Eyes,True,"This is a world of dreams and reverie
Where I felt the stars explode around me
A grass blade flashed with a gleam
As it slashed open a moonbeam
And I stared back breathlessly
As mountains of fruit tumbled out
I barely had the chance to shout
""Oh strawberry avalanche, crash over me!""
Staying awake that night was rather hard
Deep in a sleeping bag in your back yard
When we woke up buried alive
Beneath the fruity landslide
We both laughed hysterically
It could've been just another dream
But I swear I heard you scream
""Oh strawberry avalanche, crash over me!""
Hope is a citrus constellation in the galaxy
Scratched on the back of both my eyelids
That I've been dying to see 
If you were a beautiful sound in the echoes all around
Then I'd be your harmony
And we'd sing along with the crowds
Beneath the candy coated clouds
""Oh strawberry avalanche, please crash over me.""
This is a world of dreams and reverie
Where I felt the stars explode around me"
99,Sunburn,https://genius.com/Owl-city-sunburn-lyrics,Ocean Eyes,True,"So there we were, back home from somewhere inside my head
Oh, bravely I fought off the monsters beneath her bed
Pillars of postwar books supported my frame of mind
While she memorized the pages that I tried to not hide
Behind
She took my hand in hers and whispered her love for me
The lantern died that night but we didn't need to see
Implying that she's the bee's knees and I am the cat's meow
It's funny how she recalls what I can't remember now
But when her smile came back
And I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack
Just because she looked so adorable
We both put our sunblock on
Played on the beach and vowed
That we'd live and we'd learn
Yeah, but she got a tan and
I got a sunburn
I got a sunburn
So there we were out there, unaware of where we'd been
We kicked off our flip-flops and swung from the rooftops again
It's awkward but I'll confess she's all I can think about
And it's funny how I recall what she can't remember now
But when her smile came back
And I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack
Just because she looked so adorable
We both put our sunblock on
Played on the beach and vowed
That we'd live and we'd learn
Yeah, but she got a tan and
I got a sunburn
Oh, afterglow, look out below
We left a trail of dust behind
As we parted ways, she held my gaze
And left an imprint on my mind
I tried not to cry as we said goodbye
And hung the clouds above my town
But I shed a tear when she disappeared
'Cause now I'm a stranger on the ground
(When her smile came back
And I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack)
We both put our sunblock on
Played on the beach and vowed
That we'd live and we'd learn

She got a tan and I got a sunburn
Yeah, but she got a tan and I got a sunburn"
102,Take It All Away,https://genius.com/Owl-city-take-it-all-away-lyrics,The Midsummer Station,True,"There was a shot in the dark
I was caught by surprise
There was a hole in my heart
There were tears in your eyes
And there was nothing to say
Because you made up your mind
And so I guess what you meant
When you left was goodbye
So if you're going to go
And leave me in a lonely gray
I won't let it show
Until you finally flown away
You got to know that you tear me up
When you say you want to take it all away, take it all away
You tear me up when you say
You want to take it all away, take it all away!
You were the one, and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of!
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it away, take away!
I felt a pain in my chest with your kiss on my cheek
And as I tried to digest the words I couldn't believe
I'm left with nothing to say with my heart on my sleeve
Making it easy to hurt, and even harder to breathe
So if you're going to go
And leave me in a lonely gray
I won't let it show
Until you finally flown away
You got to know that you tear me up
When you say you want to take it all away, take it all away
You tear me up when you say
You want to take it all away, take it all away!
You were the one, and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of!

Whenever we pretend it's summer
Then I'm the worm
I know the part, it's such a bummer
But fair is fair
If my segments get separated
I'll scream
And you'll be there
Close your eyes
Slide the cotton off of your shoulder
And feel the shine
I'm hooked so toss me over
And cast the line
I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends
As they arrive
You and I left our troubles far behind
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With friends like these, well
Who needs enemies?
If I'm your boy
Let's take a shortcut we remember
And we'll enjoy
Picking apples in late September like
We've done for years
Then we'll take a long walk
Through the cornfield
And I'll kiss you
Between the ears
If you're my girl
Swirl me around your room with feeling
And as we twirl
The glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us
As love sweeps over the room
Because we tend to make
Each other blush
You and I left our troubles far behind
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With fronds like these, well
Who needs anemones?
You're the bird, I'm the worm
And it's plain to see
That we were meant to be
We were meant to be
We were meant to be
If you're the bird
If you're the bird
Then I'm the worm
We were meant to be"
111,The Tip Of The Iceberg,https://genius.com/Owl-city-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-lyrics,Ocean Eyes,True,"Welcome back
Winter once again
And put on your warm fuzzy sweater
Because you'll feel much better when
The snowflakes fall
Gently to the ground
The temperature drops
And your shivers freeze all the rivers around
But I keep you warm
If speed's a pro
Inertia must be a con
Because the cold wind blows at precise rates
When I've got my ice skates on
If all the roads
Were paved with ice that wouldn't thaw or crack
I could skate from Maine to Nebraska
Then on to Alaska and back
Because you keep me warm
Peer over the edge
Can you see me?
Rivulets flow from your eyes
Paint runs from your mouth
Like a waterfall
And your lungs crystalize
I'll travel the sub-zero tundra
I'll brave glaciers and frozen lakes
And that's just the tip of the iceberg
I'll do whatever it takes
To change
Farewell powdery paradise
We'd rather skate on the thinnest ice
Fingers failed us before they froze
Frostbite bit down on all our toes
Snow drifts build up and enfold us
As we wait out this winter storm
So we snuggle close in the darkness
And keep each other so warm"
113,This Isn’t the End,https://genius.com/Owl-city-this-isnt-the-end-lyrics,Mobile Orchestra,True,"An 8 year old girl had a panic attack
Cause the father she loved left and never looked back
No longer the hero, she counted on
He told her he loved her and then he was gone
She tried to look happy in front of her friends
But knew that she'd never feel normal again
She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes
And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye
When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out this isn't the end
Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked
But nobody knew he was dying inside
He promised his family he'd be all right
And then with a gunshot he left them behind
When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out this isn't the end
When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out this isn't the end
The role of a father, he never deserved
He abandoned his daughter and never returned
And over the years though the pain was real
She finally forgave him, and started to heal
How close is the ending? Well, nobody knows
The future's a mystery and anything goes
Love is confusing and life is hard
You fight to survive cause you made it this far
It's all too astounding to comprehend
It's just the beginning this isn't the end
It's just the beginning this isn't the end"

'Cause I believe you'd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve
All my life I wish I broke mirrors, instead of promises
'Cause all I see, is a shattered conscience staring right back at me
I wish I had covered all my tracks completely 'cause I'm so afraid
Is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just the train?
Lift your arms only heaven knows, where the danger grows
And it's safe to say there's a bright light up ahead and
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave, and sorrow swept over me
Depression, please cut to the chase and cut a long story short
Oh please be done. How much longer can this drama afford to run?
Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties and breaks whatever doesn't bend. But sadly then, all my heavy hopes just pull me back down again
Back down again, back down again, back down again, back down again, back down again, back down again, back down again
I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave, and sorrow swept over me
Then I was given grace and love, I was blind but now I can see
'Cause I found a new hope from above, and courage swept over me
It hurts just to wake up, whenever you're wearing thin
Alone on the outside, so tired of looking in
The end is uncertain and I've never been so afraid
But I don't need a telescope to see that there's hope
And that makes me feel brave"

When chandeliers light up the engine room

There's an underwater Ferris wheel
Where I found the missing link to this island chain
Home will always be here, unseen; out of sight
Where I disappear and hide
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
So I'll spread out my wings and fly
Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
Hidden under umbrella beach
Home will always be here, unseen; out of sight
Where I disappear and hide
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
So I'll spread out my wings and fly
Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
Hidden under umbrella beach"
121,Unbelievable,https://genius.com/Owl-city-unbelievable-lyrics,Mobile Orchestra,True,"It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable
When I was a kid I saved up all my dough so I could buy C-3PO
Put Mentos in my Diet Coke in the backseat of the bus
When I was a kid I ate ""Spaghetti Os"", played laser tag and GI Joe's
And if you vowed no girls allowed then you could join the club
When I was I was a kid I spent my Saturday's
Blowin' on Nintendo games
The newest thing was Lion King and I could feel the love
It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable
When I was a kid I dreamed of Power Wheels
Stayed up late watching action films
And I won't lie, my friends and I, were too legit to quit
When I was a kid I lived for climbing trees and Dr Pepper jellybeans
My favorite part of ""Jurassic Park"" was how real the Raptors looked
When I was a kid I still had VHS, watched Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff, Zack Morris owned the first cell phone, it was off the hook!
It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable
Gak, pogs, and floam and Home Alone, Berenstein bears and bean bag chairs
My L.A. Looks and Goosebumps books, oh Etch-a-sketch
What happens next?
Grape juicy juice and Dr. Seuss, piggy-back rides and
Slip-n-slides, McDonalds Fries, those were the best
What happens next?
It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, those were the days oh-oh
It’s unbelievable
When I think back on my name
It’s unbelievable
Cause baby those were the days
It’s unbelievable
It ruled in so many ways
It’s unbelievable, it’s unbelievable"
123,Vanilla Twilight,https://genius.com/Owl-city-vanilla-twilight-lyrics,Ocean Eyes,True,"The stars lean down to kiss you
And I lie awake and miss you
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere
'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly
But I'll miss your arms around me
I'd send a postcard to you dear
'Cause I wish you were here
I'll watch the night turn light blue
But it's not the same without you
Because it takes two to whisper quietly
The silence isn't so bad
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad
'Cause the spaces between my fingers are
Right where yours fit perfectly
I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone
But drenched in vanilla twilight
I'll sit on the front porch all night
Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you
I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone
As many times as I blink, I'll think of you tonight
I'll think of you tonight
When violet eyes get brighter
And heavy wings grow lighter
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again
And I'll forget the world that I knew
But I swear I won't forget you
Oh, if my voice could reach back through the past
I'd whisper in your ear
""Oh darling, I wish you were here"""
124,Verge,https://genius.com/Owl-city-verge-lyrics,Mobile Orchestra,True,"Ain't too sure what I believe in
I believe in what I see
And when I close my eyes
I see my whole life ahead of me
These are our hours
This is our time 
These are our hours
Out on the verge
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the Earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives
These are our hours
This is our time
These are our hours
Out on the verge
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the Earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives
From now on, there’s no looking back
Full-steam ahead on this one-way track
From this day forth, I will make a promise
To be true to myself and always be honest
For the rest of my life
I will do what’s right
I will do what’s right
When I'm step out on the verge
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the Earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives
Edge of the Earth and we’re touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives"
133,You’re Not Alone,https://genius.com/Owl-city-youre-not-alone-lyrics,Mobile Orchestra,True,"Some days I barely hold on
When life drags me down
I wanna let go
But when my spirit is weak
You come to my aid
And strengthen my soul
I'm lost without You
I'll never doubt You
Your grace is beyond compare
And though when it rains, it pours
You know all I have is Yours
You smile when You hear my prayer
You rescued me, and I believe
That God is love, and He is all I need
From this day forth, for all eternity
I'll never wander on my own
For I am yours until you call me home
I close my eyes, and I can hear you say
“You're not alone”, oh oh-oh
“You're not alone”, oh oh-oh
Some days I just can't go on
I stumble and fall
And I hang my head
But you reach out for my hand
And You lift me up
Again and again
Oh, yes you do
In the face of my depravity
For God so loved the world, He died for me, yeah
My fire burns, ‘till He returns
And takes me home beyond the galaxy
You're not, you're not alone
Never alone …"
