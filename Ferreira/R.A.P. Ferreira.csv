0,ABSOLUTES,https://genius.com/Rap-ferreira-absolutes-lyrics,purple moonlight pages,True,"Hassle proof, spit it in nothin' but absolutes
I don't remember askin' you for a comment
S'posed to feel like bombardment
Vigorous work, the real jerk, no Steve Martin
No he not Spartan, no he not sparrin'
My mind's favorite yoga pose is pullin' okey dokes
Heroes turn to hoagie rolls, it's so laborious
I plot peace as a coordinate
My dojo taught insubordinance is glorious
I prefer when they forfeit, tap out, rap mount
The bag is bounced past, then I cash out
Left a note said, left a note said, left a note said
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
Back of the note had a post script reading
At her I marveled, fiddles with whale bone toggle
Herself is the obstacle, fossilization ain't optional
Survival isn't logical, niggas became absurdists, surrealists, dada flows
S'pose you can holler if you feel this
Those beyond the tasteful, a trip to Office Max for staples
This shit is graceful
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
Open the mouth to give testimony, bear witness
You need fresh air and a prayer for forgiveness
Tuck and weave, like Febreeze, particulates
You know my tongue be ticklish
You have my active thanks
The rhythm become sacrosanct
Dandelion wine on an empty stomach
Broke the bank, stretched the budget
Broke the bank, stretched the budget
I played the wake, sampled the buffet
Left some flowers by the grave
I sampled the buffet, played the wake
Left some flowers by the grave
So when I die I won't stay
Dead"
1,AN IDEA IS A WORK OF ART,https://genius.com/Rap-ferreira-an-idea-is-a-work-of-art-lyrics,purple moonlight pages,True,"On a quest to get open and free
Indeed, on a quest to get open and free
I do as I please as it pleases me
Sneezed on the knee of an MC most egregiously
Never begged they pardon calling my behavior modern
I circumambulate with the psycho-active animate
Basket case candidate for high stakes life, gambling
I'm ambling to the greater matter with my gray matter
Build gray matters, build better answers to destructive questions
Mother inventions, weathering God's pop quizzes
No matter what the odds, isn't odd, isn't it
How this wall between us dislodge with one fidget
It's not a gimmick, but a superpower
I've seen whole crews devoured by a person who is now a tagline on a bodybag
Bagpipes cause you had to lollygag
Gully gully wall with the Buddy Holly walk in Islamabad
Or it felt like it
Yelling Hellfyre into microphones, came out swingin'
Vaseline on forehead, winner sorted
Fiddlesticks, write a riddle to grant your own wish
Toss the homie a beat like ""hold this""
Art rap globalist, legion of hoodwinkers
Seasonal mood lingers, among broke bootleggers
Hoop jumper for pleasures
The many ventures of them pennypinchers
The skinny ledger leaker
Minute hedge fund freaker, done being a thinker
Hehe, 'til we meet again
At the Comfort Inn, hunny hunnerin
At the Comfort Inn, hunny hunnerin
It's the other who others whoever
It's the other who others whoever
On the quest to get open and free
On the quest to get open and free
Ran through a lot of gasoline
Ran through a lot of gasoline
It's the opposite of picking cotton
Rule number five
It's the opposite of picking cotton
On the quest to get open and free
We built better answers
It's the others who other whoever
It's the others who other whoever
On the quest to get open and free
A quest to get open and free
Ponder this Einstein
How does music fold space and time?
Realign locations with emotional space and verse stations
Less diverse is Hawking's with the gate open
Two billion ghosts walking the base of oceans
I'm talking about the base of the crossing
The low end to the screen
More frequencies in between and some focus on the moon
But this base was born on an island of survivors and reverberations and depths of millions of square miles
Our blues born from the deepest blue and black and green that got us through
Psychosomatic smokescreens to flip the world over
We ride trauma like moguls on slopes
Invoking old moguls in hopes royal lines will guide us
What if royalty despised us?
And there's no chosen, no laws
Just Rakim on them mountaintops
Or Nazir at Harvards by Paul
We're riding waves in centuries before slave trades no surprise we glide on the micros
One off bars on technos
 we gonna ease into Cantonese
Same with Ingles, Francais, and Espanol
Meandering through Mandarin with a one that's one million years old
This beat is gold
Ergo, milo knows the only gold is soul
That's what Columbus was really looking for
It's the others who other whoever
It's the others who other whoever
On the quest to get open and free
The quest to get open and free"
6,CYCLES,https://genius.com/Rap-ferreira-cycles-lyrics,purple moonlight pages,True,"It was gonna be a big summer, you know, a big summer
Every one since then too, ""a big summer""
""Gonna be a big summer""
Yet, somehow that's never the case, is it?
It's the sprawl of autumn, isn't it?
It's the crunch, where one can never daytrip
You know living myths can come true
Sometime it might happen to you, especially if you live outside of time
Anyway, the rhyme you are about to hear isn't true
But, it isn't false either
Any resemblance between this rhythm poetic exploration in reality is
Purely magical, purely magical
At the end of the world, we was fightin' back with brushes and pens
We decided that the suffering should end, no matter how good it feels
Wooden shields ain't stoppin' bullets
So we dropped those, quit lyin' to ourselves
Started writin' poems, got stronger by ourselves
Kinship bein' the hunger that we felt, so we trusted that
Made moves from it
Got busted backs, bruised stomachs
Ruby yacht, whole crew illustrious
We did those stints, tenures, benders, bent censures, spent ledgers
Unyielding, a taste of they own medicine
Every member is also president
How could you stop what you can't clot, hmm?
But things go backwards, the wrong people get placards
You get a collection of spatulas, heavy brow lines
Sacrificing down time for the wrong guys' good graces
Shoulda held them aces and betted on self
Eventually we're all just heads on a shelf
Trophies in cupboards, mopey customer
Doping up for a big day again, really it bores me
We're the stuff that's so boring, hijacking stories
Sapping the gold from the blood
MOG started from MUD
Be the first ones to judge
Funny how cycles work, funny how cycles work
Swear I just know my worth, swear I just know my worth
Funny how cycles work, funny how cycles work
Swear I just know my worth, swear I just know my worth
Funny how cycles work, funny how cycles work
Swear I just know my worth, swear I just know my worth
Swear I just know my worth
Funny how cycles work, funny how cycles work
Swear I just know my worth, swear I just know my worth
Funny how cycles work

7,DECORUM,https://genius.com/Rap-ferreira-decorum-lyrics,purple moonlight pages,True,"Fence building nihilists, good evening
This is the late sleeping utopian speaking
Brother of the wind and the wisdom body
Him who has the filthy fits, Black Orpheus
High yellow, the sly rebel indeed
It is the corduroy coon prince of the moon boot fit
Mr. lime rickey tickin' off beat, parsel-tongue like feet, no lorry
Green horses run like Porsche Carrera
Of course it's Rory Allen Phillip Ferreira
None other than, the ignoble peon poet from nowhere
Joined by my family in funkonomics, the high vibrational minister
The Jefferson Park Boys
That's Mr. Kenny Segal, void peeker
Renowned in wide reaching concentric eccentric circles
For dropping desks rhythmically and grilling pineapples
Mr. Mike Parvizi of the golden thumb
Plucking poetics from the air as he struts down bass lines with nimble awareness
A crossing guard smoking on the job
And Mr. Aaron Carmack, head on a swivel
Profane keeper of the bop, master of sonic delights
Transistor and transmutator, exuding elegance like freedom
Good evening, thank you for joining us
This transmission is addressed to the fence building nihilists
Your soul writes, ""come home""
Abandon them outdated strategies, namely hatred
Exile is no place for a person, or your compassion
Come home
Good evening
Good evening"
9,DOLDRUMS,https://genius.com/Rap-ferreira-doldrums-lyrics,purple moonlight pages,True,"I wrote this outside of Wegmans. After they kicked me out for, for kickin', kickin’ too many rhymes
Endure the doldrums
Severe learning, my middle hurting
Growing up and it's to be such a little person
Dissapointment cloaks resentment
Wearing a cloak in Wegmans and being escorted out
Is this what rap's about? What do you rap about?
Miscellaneous capers, visually zany language
To maim my baby’s brain wit
That's why I only play my raps round him
Naps soundin' reasonable
So I take one, might cook all day
And I call that luxury
If them supremacists need a enemy, I'm your Hucklebee
You not gon' outwit, out-plot, out-steal or muzzle me
Won't even mention hustling, it's puzzling
When the meek act Big Willie, shit really
Just kick back and inherit the world 
Just kick back and inherit the world 
Just kick back and inherit the world 
Just kick back
Scrape scraps, pieces, hacks, master tongue
Bastard, plug seven, lung, reverance
Great antennas, increased livity
Recognize the signs of cycle, slow farming humility
I accept the mystery, I accept the mystery
I accept the mystery, I accept the mystery
Superstitious metaphysics, stained with humdrum
All my homies sufferin' the same conundrum
Superstitious metaphysics, stained with humdrum
All my homies sufferin’ the same conundrum
Superstitious metaphysics, stained with humdrum
All my homies sufferin’ the same
And the goal is to retain, the goal is to retain
The goal is to retain the most whole
It's the soul folks, it’s the soul folks
It's the soul folks, it's the soul folks
Can you find the level of difficulty in this?
Can you find the level of jubilee in this?
Can you find the level of revelry in this?
Can you find the level of freedom in this?
Can you find the level of spirit in this?"
11,DUST UP,https://genius.com/Rap-ferreira-dust-up-lyrics,purple moonlight pages,True,"The back of my mind is blank obsidian
MS-DOS screen, white line blinking
Ice-nine peeling
There is no search for what's natural, programmer
Roll rider, windjammer, in tune with shadow and act
Well lit projections, tryin’ to deconstruct metaphysics for me
From Hakim to Yasin, I'm in Casco Bay, Casca wit' me
Stayin’ at the Hotel Scallops room, February 3rd
Whisper singing Nelly Furtado, wishing I was a Yardbird
Plastic saxophone, ashy metronome
My grandmomma called Vaseline grease
I remember wearin' Jordans on the South Side
When Jordan played for the Bulls and I wasn't allowed outside
If this is my mind, I'll step out-side
Hull integrity full
Classic landscape, ripe fruit and house flies
Brought a broom to a dust-up
You rap like your footwork fucked up
We planned for hiccups, obstructionists
Stick up kids and the mogs on powerpoint
Talkin' 'bout quantum futurism but ain't got space ships
Ain't got schematics, ain’t got personnel training or catering
No defense budget
I write this from the Soul Folks vessel Ruby Yacht ancestral mothership
Plottin’ coordinates to peace, hull integrity full
Five thousand parsecs beyond trans warp
With a fresh oil change, come test it if you bad
Wrote it wearin' a burlap durag
My humblest experience in truth came packaged as a thought in this sense:
The map is the only territory
When I say out loud, ""the world is my idea""
When I say out loud, ""suede Timbs on my feet make my cipher complete""
I am saying the same thing out loud
I find comfort in the allegory of the journey
Because I am in a literal search for brightness, voluptuousness
Brimming clarity in service of nothing else
I know that one’s resolve for life can be determined
According to translation errors inherited
My understanding itself being a summation of a suggestion of which the scope is beyond me
And I hope to only ever be utilized and in service of another's journey
There was a census taken among the grand verbalizers
There was a, um, a census taken among only the grand verbalizers
And then the data was compiled, necessarily crunched, meaning it was sorted
In such a way one could understand, or at least make use of, and by extension, give one license to imitate in understanding
After the data was compiled, crunched, there was a consensus among only the grand verbalizers:
""Wack muhfuckers always want a re-do.""
My left eye sees in the garden of my mind clearly now
There are four heroes"
13,GOLDEN SARDINE,https://genius.com/Rap-ferreira-golden-sardine-lyrics,purple moonlight pages,True,"Head honcho in a poncho like Bob Kaufman
Ancient rain from the tonsils
Boil the coconut rice, I tear the cilantro
Heard y'all still experiment with dirty Henny
Me, I publish the City Lights like Ferlinghetti
Lusty stare, your boy paid to open the door like concierge
I no longer count the years
You’ve grown accustomed to acting from fear
Good laugh in the mirror
Silence follows cunning, rice pot humming
Nod off like a loose fez
The Howdy Doody guitar player gets suplexed
He not right, might pop like Enoch Light
No subliminals, knowledge at intervals, it's a rare science
In a cave with several dark thoughts and a clear mind
Have blues, will travel, a horse with no name, no saddle
Purse big enough to post bail and skedaddle
My projections are astral
Stormy weather copacetic, Bojangles asthetic
Tiptoe leverage
What's mine is in my mind
What is the price of glory, fire in the conservatory
What’s mine is in my mind
What's mine is in my
Bubble goose
Money flow four-fold like noble truth
Green lung coughed, fill the coffer
Slow menace stalker, when a negotiator's not a talker
Times of peril is always hella awkward
I know what you're pondering
And I keep that portion of the mind roped off from wandering
It smell of pomegranate, pears, soil
How they acts like they're unaware of toiled repetition
Make it meaningless, or is that the creation ritual
Space station habitual, the great ape made individuals
Them cut off from they roots, nah we not in cahoots
But there's an understanding, which is all one could ever ask for
Consider this my resignation from the task force
Consider this my resignation, consider this my resignation
What's mine is in my mind, what's mine is in my, yeah
And it’s like that, and that’s the way it is
What is the price of glory, fire in the conservatory
I'll pull that six-shooter out on him real quick, yeah
Reach for the sky, yeah, reach for the sky"

R.A.P. presidin', word
A so called negro stood there, spitting
Ten thousand lines of poetry
In conclusion, if I'm younger, you still not as old as me
This ain't my first time, this ain't my first time
Brown seed, brown pores, like molasses bread
Slow breathin' through the scary shit
Neophyte gambler, blue light dancer
Aquarius, walkin' with my angels
No need to measure the obtuse angle
Clanger of loose bangles
Measurin' stars with the space between my fingers
Truth is power, speakin' only to the little flower stalk lingers
A warrior don't need to test their meddle, stay blessed
And then he kissed every petal
Empty make a better vessel, ya know what I mean?
And our color shall be green, as we tend to grow
Tend to matters of hope, tend to be tender
Gardener of letters, king hat pretender
Benevolence lender, no interest rate
Ruby yacht ain't met a crest we couldn't break
Needless to say, the cipher's secure
However, your processor need a reboot to update
 which, the boys in blue investigate)
What's poppin', uh, cipher rotten
Newport smoked down to the cotton
It's simple mathematics, refracted madness
Wrote the rhyme with fridge magnets
Daydreamin' the whole lunch
Under an bowl cut
Eddie Jefferson singin', ""so what?""
This is music for quitters and dropouts
This is music for the flophouse
""Gimme my props now"", I say clanging my briefcase
Can you believe the nerve of these cheapskates?
Hogging sunlight and the technology behind photosynthesis
Let's measure rhythms in distances
The speed goes twenty-nine million miles before movin'
I think I'm improving, but who can say?
Since no point is fixed, more or less
I think my point is missed
I've decided to embrace what differentiates me from the anointed clique
Ruby yacht land ownership
Let's build a monument, and stand over it
Hand in hand, off-sides, odd pride
Like watching your kid's first tantrum
A relevant dataset
Lost alpha, now pay the bet
Beta, hepcat see ya later
Walk up in the building like I'm sposed to be here
But anyway
What did you have for lunch today? I had some daydreams myself, mmm. Yes and after all that rough sledding, that heavy lifting, a clear vista opened before me and a profound wave of understanding washed over me. And, and you know, the blues, the blues will fade. And the greens, the greens, they, they rush over you. The lush beautiful green, filled everything from the periphery to the center"
16,LAUNDRY,https://genius.com/Rap-ferreira-laundry-lyrics,purple moonlight pages,True,"Another day, another load of laundry
Soon as I woke up, that feeling was hauntin' me
Another dad with a hamper
I wonder if Chance the Rapper do his own laundry
Who cares?
I scoop socks calmly from under chairs
Underwears is its own load and spin cycle
Towels too, how are you?
I been busy keepin' this home together, you know
A family just growin' together
The hoverin' scent of cool linens
While the loop demands the fools keep sinnin'
Myself included, shit
I'm just hummin' in the kitchen, my son listenin'
He stare with them wide ol' eyes
Hummin' in the kitchen, my son listenin'
He stare with them wide ol' eyes
I'm hummin' in the kitchen, my son listenin'
He stare with them wide ol' eyes
We doin' laundry, we doin' laundry
We doin' laundry, we doin' laundry
You know the devil is a liar, silk pants don't go in the dryer
Hang 'em on the back of Bobby's recliner
I feel inspired by the shuffle of my fold
Cut a jib, born of my rib
We should have four or five hundred kids
I wonder how many loads of laundry that is
How many bottles of Gain will I gain in this game
Former rappers is fast dog walkers or podcast talkers
If the loose shoe fit
Perhaps I will launder zoot suits for tips on tour with mariachi dancers
You know that's not an applicable answer for a ten year plan
But, I'm sure it'll all go according to plan
Unless, unless...
Presently I'm just, you know
Hummin' in the kitchen, my son listenin'
He starin' with them wide ol' eyes
Hummin' in the kitchen, my son listenin'
He starin' with them wide ol' eyes
Hummin' in the kitchen
We doin' laundry, we doin' laundry"
17,LEAVING HELL,https://genius.com/Rap-ferreira-leaving-hell-lyrics,purple moonlight pages,True,"Twisted world where artists bend backwards for benefactors
And victims are to be blamed as bad actors
My mind running all around
Poetry is illegal unless you're under the undergound
Devious with determination
Solitude is crowded by isolation
Wandered wearily for several eternities
Gaining acclaim, using fake names
Vanishing by sunrise, committing to the wisdom of the unwise
In buildings where if I wasn't a performer, they wouldn't let me past the foyer
Here I am pullin' spectacles for the uninitiated voyeurs
But, bein' piss poor corrupted the discourse
As power functions on a sliding scale, so you might as well
So you might as well, you know what I'm sayin'
And that's when I knew I'd found
My way out of this hell
And that's when I knew I'd found
My way out of this hell
Strivin' to be the type of poet Lorca was
When one turns their back to lead the orchestra
Black orpheus, Kepler octahedron
Happy recent, eyes buggin' like Jackie Gleason
To witness true wonder, that's the reason
That's the reason
One time I was doo-dooin' at a gas station and I
Read on the stall, you know, on the wall
""What's the purpose of life?""
And someone had actually wrote back, it said:
""To be the eyes, the ears, and consciousness of the creator of the universe. You fool!""
And that's when I knew I'd found
My way out of this hell
Break it down, break it down
And that's when I knew I'd found
My way out of this hell
Thank you, thank you art, thank you music

My way out of this hell"

Joy and happiness did reign and each one knew their worth
In my heart how I yearn for the spirit's return
And I, and I cry as time flies, as time flies
There is a place where love forever shines
And rainbows are the shadows of a presence so divine and the glow of that love
We’ll light the sky, up above
And it's free, come with me, can't you see
The creator has a master plan
Peace and happiness through all the land
The creator has a master plan
Peace and happiness through all the land
The creator has a working plan
Peace and happiness through all the land

Natty dread, El DeBarge

I might be on one
Icy hot numb
Met eyes, locked thumbs, this my wedding shotgun
Drums like stampeding oxen
I guess you lost 'em
B210 Datsun
Flossin', Powers, Austin
With the asparagus fern
Time couldn't justify the arrogance earned
More holes and old lies at the speed lead nosedives
The fallacy of both sides, ghost ride the subconsciousness
Extra medium and I'm off the shits
Confrontation with its awkwardness
Under the parlor Palm, martyr calm as ever
Need a harder beverage like I need a hemorrhage and corroded artery, not hardly
Altered the car battery with an open chest, recharge it
We not starving artists, we not starving
We not starving artists, we not starving
Giovanni Ribisi type sneaky, go-getter, vegan white cheddar, please, panini croissant
I don't know if the message is getting across
Mythical like a sack of dirt from a free black nation
Five-fifths mic check, my inner fire is high tech
The world is run by stress
Blessings multiply with acknowledgment
In my household this is common sense
Peace of mind would be a worthwhile accomplishment
We abandoned the fortress
How does famine inform the gorgeous
Mammon and Gore endorsements
Littering the timeline, bickering on boxed wine
The cavalry comes babbling, casualty-cum-laude
Only the moon seen my outtakes
Met the same disaster, trying to confront the game master
Hypnosis, wooly Moses, okra, oats, ocean
Space Princess Lumpy dancin' for me

Covering ground as well
Violence is the groove, pan-frying breadfruit

Soundcheck the daily stock holding
There go that plot roaming
Rate supply, epicanthic eye fold, accept the charges
Brace for life's barrages, cohens, and eavesdroppers
Plea coppers and bargain hunters
Marginalia conductor, alien other
Outside in the outside, her mouth wider
Need more air to stoke this great fire

Move with ease and grace
Most modernness plagued with hesitancy

It's true
You know the self is defined by the struggling
Found pain in the, found the
Found the pain quite, quite, quite humbling
You know the self is defined by the struggling
Dare to peek through the viewfinder
Up close with a rude reminder
Deuteronomy in E minor
Shuffling chicken bones
Searchin' for hidden tones and meanings
Niggas was triangulatin' the feelin'
Hidden motives turn to rigor mortis
With rigid hortense, vivid reminders of why I don't like surprises
Behind the curtain like Polonius
Screams of pain and they hittin' most melodius
Tell yourself that ain't odious, ock, it's only obvious
It's bogus whoadie, I'm Bodie Broadus singin' Spottie Ottie
With the loaded pop, and that's a metaphor, really
You know the vagabond drifty, troubadour shifty
Like the two things shifted, perspective be infinite
Perpetually lifted, the most high gifts abundant
Soul folks glow illustrious
You move too slow to fuck wit' us
Feelin' lucid in the foreign model
Too scoops in my affogato
It's neohoodoo's most loyal apostle, Pete

Non-cipher, you a nonplussed biter"

Only to find the method used erroneous

Why those low frequencies be your final destination, huh?
Singing weeping willows, while that Dilla swing
Coax the bellowing from the center solar plexus
Noble savage, ghost ride the Lexus
Parallel universe, we was bumpin' letters to Alexis
Never have I ever been impressed with
How they compromise the message for the spectacle of presence of the respectable heckler
I widen the vector, you clowns pine to be victor
I pivot to miss her
Curvature of the swerve became permanent fixture
Like, old timey sangs in Jaime's basement with the whiny faces
These hidden forces propelling the door swing
Arpeggiated with poems
Rode into the sunset on a ark of bones
Cultural mothership, turned to sacred utterance
Dalliance, an army of one green stallion, we growin' scallions
Yeah
Sorry to say, I've fallen off the wheel
Built yourself back, shoulder chip by shoulder chip
Only to find the method used erroneous
Why you always transmittin' from a place of desperation?

Old, old, totem
They're still getting off on confessional prose poems, bold omens
Professional rappers often only heard post mortem
Perhaps try trade school, electrician training seems prescient
The best apprentices are a tad hesitant, teachers too
Most people try to delete their blues, and with it most of life
But, those are dirty thoughts on such a gorgeous night
This beat sound like a long walk to the dumpster
Funk like nostrils of muenster, mad myself an apostle of wonder
I want to behold magnificence, I want to behold magnificence
The seed sprouted and we shouted way past rooftops
Walk across, indeed, poppin' bottles off
The sprout grew to sappling eye, that's what's happening
Lost in shade, then umber, the way to the under
The permanent other bardmen
Dreams are nursed in darkness and there's no parking, on foot
Preaching the rhyming word is absurdist
Pledging allegiance before reading the terms of service agreement
No antecedent, order the ancestor moth meetin'
And tonight I'm holding court with my heathens
A staff made of Pringles, beard lookin' wizardly
I remember it vividly, send the enemy my utmost sympathies
Ruby yacht, we scream it diligently, pillage differently
On a teeter totter with lasers lurks milky moon
Word to Skipp Coon
I never needed freedom papers
I never needed freedom papers
Gimme space to wave my arms around
Sword have you in the mood to put your armor down
It's the gumption of the gumshoe
Living room Kung Fu, you gon' have to catch me first
My net worth is not material
This day began with flax milk and cereal
Prolly end with rice and beans
Fuck wealth and the hype machine
Rather have health and an icy spring, or electrician training

This flow my inalienable right
Halogen bulb light, jelly donut
Gilded lily with my hillbillies on fiddle and spoons
Fiddler rooves, prince of the corduroy coons
Bust the jazz hands, she hit the lumpy dance
Lakim Shabazz enters a deep trance, levitating
Discrete demands, steady pressure, no hesitating
Pointer finger callus, pigeon pecking, no malice
And that could change with some introspecting
That's very interesting, that's very interesting
And that could change with some introspecting
That's very interesting
And then I played pinball with Zev Love X
And then I played pinball with Zev Love X
And then I played pinball with Zev Love X
R.A.P. Ferreira run your tape deck
Yeah, shouts to the middle rank, it's dog eat dog
Big bank take little bank, and shouts to the ink tank
For painting my lemons gold
External modem, used to download centerfolds
It's taking all day for a mislabeled JPEG
Eight leg, body rock, rhyming like J Treads
I'm what the fire burns, flame is what I deserve
My wallet getting lighter, trying to guess what I might've earned, heavy
Hold it down like a tongue depress
Nonetheless mother-fuck more and cuddle less
Rudderless, big dumb history
I should've chose a gig with income consistently
Got a neck full of tattoo kisses
A three room house with a bathroom prison
The front looks good but the back tooth's missing
And Geti said we walk like jazz musicians"
26,RO TALK,https://genius.com/Rap-ferreira-ro-talk-lyrics,purple moonlight pages,True,"Pure will in every moment, baby. That's all I can recommend. It's funny, it be the instinct to protect make you strike first. In a surveillance state, everyone is a performer, those that push to be influencers, less rigid artist types that garner followings. You know what I'm talking about? Creatives. Those people, they don't do nothin'. And that's cool, but when surveillance is weaponized, it can project limits on human interaction, or at least, that's how I see it. So, I advise pure will in every moment, beloved. Pure will in every moment. There are no good ideas. Pure will in every moment, beloved. 
That nigga rhyme book look like a Mondrian
Bless up to Piff James and Hommy Hom
And the people lurkin' in Soulfolks for the ambiance
While I spin this caldera, Rock a coif like Greg Porter
I get the extra order, I go the extra inning
You know I get extra wit' it
All types of multi-syllabics in need of extra whippin'
Ruby yacht fabric, you know I'm extra fitted
Ambiguity defeat the pattern recognition
Asking ""who are you?"" to me as in a absolutist question
If I had to answer that I'd rather skip the whole confession
Sound right reasoning orange the song seasoning
Tight mouthfeel, hype soul sold for mass appeal
And the need hold itself like Rollo
Big fingers pluck pizzicato
And this be about victory and this be about triumph
In Tim Hortons, dressed like a transformer
Talking 'bout Jacob Lawrence portraits
Whole lifetime go by as an active tourist
Disaster insurance is a sound investment
Pounds daps and blessings
Ain't as clean as he used to be
Whole bunch of meanness in my used to be
Alpha cromagnate, hopes stagnate
Boast through the back aches and of the stomach ulcers, foreclosures
Meditate on nothingness, sequence keystroke to delete question
Does the sun rise? Repeat, replace, and posit
Adopt the logic of Duck Rogers, remain adamant, remain adamant
My ancestors had they hands on it, Venetian peak
Read it in Tahitian Treat like a cool breeze
How Elohim speak until it isn't
The plot, no pot, thickens as the Gestapo stop me on the way home
Pawning writtens as freestyles
Levy finds and update files with utter convenience
Now I turn to the audience and mutter, ""all authority is deviance""
Malaclypse the Younger said it best
I keep that hunger in my chest, I keep that Yoda in the vest
But, since I'm poor, I don't rap like that
I desperately need to be understood
I desperately need understanding
Ain't as clean as he used to be
Whole bunch of meanness in my used to be
Sight is useful, but not necessary
Sight is useful, but not necessary
Sight is useful, but not necessary
Nimzo-Indian, gizmo images, a Gitmo citizen
Bitcoin dividends, zip-line fetishes
Science and its lettuces
Lattices at ease, I scoff at my need
Life brings me to my knees
You repeat as you please
I repeat as I please
The list of lovers whom you held hands with
Blumenfeld gambit, the automaton stammered
The gearshift's standard, but reads like a manual
Ride like a sweet chariot at the family annual
Over here it's, fuck a stereotype-a
Bury those type, you know we bury those, right?
You could never catch the left, only lookin' for the right
Shit, it's simple mathematics
Dark square bishop, the GM hiccups
 couch surfin' like the man from Galilee
Do drop in, do drop in, do drop in"

King poetical dingbat, hip cat science
Theoretical ink splat, scope that
Wingding, impeccable Hulk stache
Versaille oak path, ruby yacht be the GOAT in gas
Lotus staff to the temple dome
Overpass, overgrown grass
Luscious laugh, make the greens more vibrant
Need my own island to transmit from, admit one
Black Orpheus, nickel cadmium
Who put the bean in they back?
No heat on my naps, leanin' the strut
Never the flask, mean on wax
Nicer in person, not quite friendly
Right hand tempted, R.A.P. Ferreira run the beat like Caster Semenya
A rasher of catastrophes is how you break a fast
Sand blasted brass, hiccuping PlayStation
Found our in when they was hesitatin'
Me and mine, you know we hella patient
Me and mine, you know we
One fell stroke, no with the L in the hell hole
Shell toe genie, blue meanie
A cosmology Luchini, an odd policy
You startled me with all that thirstiness
Blind lemon, Ice 9 meltin'
Helmet made of toothpicks starts rusting openly
Texas Hold 'em with only me
Well, Horace Silver was there grinning, but not playing
Praying but not
Forget to pay the toll and then the letter comes
Forget to pay the toll and then the letter comes
I better get this done, but I never do
And that's the essence of what's eating at you
I say to me, in earnestness, ""did you earn this?""
Before scarfing several
Before scarfing several
As always, the question remains, ""Can you dig it?""
United Defenders of International Good Will, you dig?
It's all our turf
It's all our turf"
